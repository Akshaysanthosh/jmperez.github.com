    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m passionate about image performance optimisation and making images load fast on the web. One of the most interesting areas of exploration is placeholders: what to show when the image hasn’t loaded yet.</p><p>During the last days I have come across some loading techniques that use SVG, and I would like to describe them in this post.</p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto,f_auto,c_scale/v1509278557/jmperez-composition-primitive_j8zyfn.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px"> <small class="caption">Generating SVGs from images can be used for placeholders. Keep reading!</small></p><a id="more"></a><p>In this post we will go through these topics:</p><ul><li>Overview of different types of placeholders</li><li>SVG-based placeholders (edges, shapes and silhouettes)</li><li>Automating the process.</li></ul><h3 id="Overview-of-different-types-of-placeholders"><a href="#Overview-of-different-types-of-placeholders" class="headerlink" title="Overview of different types of placeholders"></a>Overview of different types of placeholders</h3><p>In the past <a href="/lazy-loading-images">I have written about placeholders and lazy-load of images</a>, and also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szmVNOnkwoU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talked about it</a>. When doing lazy-loading of images it’s a good idea to think about what to render as a placeholder, since it can have a big impact in user’s perceived performance. In the past I described several options:</p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto,f_auto,c_scale/v1509278557/placeholder-options_vtwp6b.png" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px"> <small class="caption">Several strategies to fill the area of an image before it loads.</small></p><ul><li><strong>Keeping the space empty for the image</strong>: In a world of responsive design, this prevents content from jumping around. Those layout changes are bad from a user’s experience point of view, but also for performance. The browser is forced to do layout re calculations every time it fetches the dimensions of an image, leaving space for it.</li><li><strong>Placeholder</strong>: Imagine that we are displaying a user’s profile image. We might want to display a silhouette in the background. This is shown while the main image is loaded, but also when that request failed or when the user didn’t set any profile picture at all. These images are usually vector-based, and due to their small size are a good candidate to be inlined.</li><li><strong>Solid colour</strong>: Take a colour from the image and use it as the background colour for the placeholder. This can be the dominant colour, the most vibrant… The idea is that it is based on the image you are loading and should help making the transition between no image to image loaded smoother.</li><li><strong>Blurry image</strong>: Also called blur-up technique. You render a tiny version of the image and then transition to the full one. The initial image is tiny both in pixels and kBs. To remove artifacts the image is scaled up and blurred. I have written previously about this on <a href="/medium-image-progressive-loading-placeholder">How Medium does progressive image loading</a>, <a href="/webp-placeholder-images">Using WebP to create tiny preview images</a>, and <a href="/more-progressive-image-loading">More examples of Progressive Image Loading</a>.</li></ul><p>Turns out there are many other variations and lots of smart people are developing other techniques to create placeholders.</p><p>One of them is having gradients instead of solid colours. The gradients can create a more accurate preview of the final image, with very little overhead (increase in payload).</p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto,f_auto,c_scale,w_1368/v1509278575/gradient-background_jyymty.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px" alt="Using gradients as backgrounds. Screenshot from Gradify"> <small class="caption">Using gradients as backgrounds. Screenshot from Gradify, which is not online anymore. Code <a href="https://github.com/fraser-hemp/gradify" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on GitHub</a>.</small></p><p>Another technique is using SVGs based on the image, which is getting some traction with recent experiments and hacks.</p><h3 id="SVG-based-placeholders"><a href="#SVG-based-placeholders" class="headerlink" title="SVG-based placeholders"></a>SVG-based placeholders</h3><p>We know SVGs are ideal for vector images. In most cases we want to load a bitmap one, so the question is how to vectorise an image. Some options are using edges, shapes and areas.</p><h4 id="Edges"><a href="#Edges" class="headerlink" title="Edges"></a>Edges</h4><p>In <a href="/drawing-edges-svg">a previous post</a> I explained how to find out the edges of an image and create an animation. My initial goal was to try to draw regions, vectorising the image, but I didn’t know how to do it. I realised that using the edges could also be innovative and I decided to animate them creating a “drawing” effect.</p><div class="codepen-aspect-ratio" style="margin-bottom: 10px; padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; width: 100%"><iframe id="cp_embed_oogqdp" src="//codepen.io/jmperez/embed/oogqdp?height=600&theme-id=0&slug-hash=oogqdp&default-tab=result" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" height="600" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" class="cp_embed_iframe" data-amp-width="600" style="width: 600; overflow: hidden"></iframe></div><h4 id="Shapes"><a href="#Shapes" class="headerlink" title="Shapes"></a>Shapes</h4><p>SVG can also be used to draw areas from the image instead of edges/borders. In a way, we would vectorise a bitmap image to create a placeholder.</p><p>Back in the days I tried to do something similar with triangles. You can see the result in my talks <a href="/cssconfau16/#/45">at CSSConf</a> and <a href="/renderconf17/#/46">Render Conf</a>.</p><div class="codepen-aspect-ratio" style="margin-bottom: 10px; padding-bottom: 74%; position: relative; width: 100%"><iframe id="cp_embed_BmaWmQ" src="//codepen.io/jmperez/embed/BmaWmQ?height=444&theme-id=0&slug-hash=BmaWmQ&default-tab=result" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" height="444" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" class="cp_embed_iframe" data-amp-width="600" style="width: 600; overflow: hidden"></iframe></div><p>The codepen above is a proof of concept of a SVG-based placeholder composed of 245 triangles. The generation of the triangles is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Delaunay triangulation</a> using <a href="https://github.com/possan/polyserver" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Possan’s polyserver</a>. As expected, the more triangles the SVG uses, the bigger the file size.</p><h4 id="Primitive-and-SQIP-a-SVG-based-LQIP-technique"><a href="#Primitive-and-SQIP-a-SVG-based-LQIP-technique" class="headerlink" title="Primitive and SQIP, a SVG-based LQIP technique"></a>Primitive and SQIP, a SVG-based LQIP technique</h4><p>Tobias Baldauf has been working on another Low-Quality Image Placeholder technique using SVGs called <a href="https://github.com/technopagan/sqip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SQIP</a>. Before digging into SQIP itself I will give an overview of <a href="https://github.com/fogleman/primitive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Primitive</a>, a library on which SQIP is based.</p><p>Primitive is quite fascinating and I definitely recommend you to check it out. It converts a bitmap image into a SVG composed of overlapping shapes. Its small size makes it suitable for inlining it straight into the page. One less roundtrip, and a meaningful placeholder within the initial HTML payload.</p><p>Primitive generates an image based on shapes like triangles, rectangles and circles (and a few others). In every step it adds a new one. The more steps, the resulting image looks closer to the original one. If your output is SVG it also means the size of the output code will be larger.</p><p>In order to understand how Primitive works, I ran it through a couple of images. I generated SVGs for the artwork using 10 shapes and 100 shapes:</p><div><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto,f_auto,c_scale,w_500/v1509367394/pexels-photo-281184-square-10.svg_ifiu2z.png" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 33vw, 228px" alt="Processing a picture through Primitive using 10 shapes" style="width:32%;float:left;margin-right:2%;padding-bottom:10px"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto,f_auto,c_scale,w_500/v1509367394/pexels-photo-281184-square-100.svg_tkr8el.png" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 33vw, 228px" alt="Processing a picture through Primitive using 100 shapes" style="width:32%;float:left;margin-right:2%;padding-bottom:10px"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto,f_auto,c_scale,w_500/v1509367395/pexels-photo-281184-square_tuhvso.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 33vw, 228px" alt="Original picture" style="width:32%;float:left;padding-bottom:10px"></div><p><small class="caption">Processing <a href="/assets/images/posts/svg-placeholders/pexels-photo-281184-square.jpg">this picture</a> using Primitive, using <a href="/assets/images/posts/svg-placeholders/pexels-photo-281184-square-10.svg">10 shapes</a> and <a href="/assets/images/posts/svg-placeholders/pexels-photo-281184-square-100.svg">100 shapes</a>.</small></p><div><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto,f_auto,c_scale,w_500/v1509367394/pexels-photo-618463-square-10.svg_aeonon.png" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 33vw, 228px" alt="Processing a picture through Primitive using 10 shapes" style="width:32%;float:left;margin-right:2%;padding-bottom:10px"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto,f_auto,c_scale,w_500/v1509367394/pexels-photo-618463-square-100.svg_t6pwcv.png" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 33vw, 228px" alt="Processing a picturethrough Primitive using 100 shapes" style="width:32%;float:left;margin-right:2%;padding-bottom:10px"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto,f_auto,c_scale,w_500/v1509367395/pexels-photo-618463-square_pmbi9x.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 33vw, 228px" alt="Original picture" style="width:32%;float:left;padding-bottom:10px"></div><p><small class="caption">Processing <a href="/assets/images/posts/svg-placeholders/pexels-photo-618463-square.jpg">this picture</a> using Primitive, using <a href="/assets/images/posts/svg-placeholders/pexels-photo-618463-square-10.svg">10 shapes</a> and <a href="/assets/images/posts/svg-placeholders/pexels-photo-618463-square-100.svg">100 shapes</a>.</small></p><p>When using 10 shapes the images we start getting a grasp of the original image.

They have a great level of detail with a still small payload. The decision of how many triangles to use will depend largely on the type of image (eg contrast, amount of colours, complexity) and level of detail.</p><p>It would be possible to create a script similar to <a href="https://github.com/technopagan/cjpeg-dssim" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cpeg-dssim</a> that tweaks the amount of shapes used until a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_similarity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">structural similarity</a> threshold is met (or a maximum number of shapes in the worst case).</p><p>These resulting SVGs are great also to use as background images. Being size-constrained and vector-based they are a good candidate for hero images and large backgrounds that otherwise would show artifacts.</p><h4 id="SQIP"><a href="#SQIP" class="headerlink" title="SQIP"></a>SQIP</h4><p>In <a href="https://github.com/technopagan/sqip" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tobias’ own words</a>:</p><blockquote><p>SQIP is an attempt to find a balance between these two extremes: it makes use of <a href="https://github.com/fogleman/primitive" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Primitive</a> to generate a SVG consisting of several simple shapes that approximate the main features visible inside the image, optimizes the SVG using <a href="https://github.com/svg/svgo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SVGO</a> and adds a Gaussian Blur filter to it. This produces a SVG placeholder which weighs in at only ~800–1000 bytes, looks smooth on all screens and provides an visual cue of image contents to come.</p></blockquote><p>The result is similar to using a tiny placeholder image for the blur-up technique (what <a href="/medium-image-progressive-loading-placeholder">Medium</a> and <a href="/more-progressive-image-loading">other sites</a> do). The difference is that instead of using a bitmap image, eg JPG or WebP, the placeholder is SVG.</p><p>If we run SQIP against the original images we’ll get this:</p><div><img

Tenemos el placer de contar con José Manuel Pérez, desarrollador web en Spotify.</strong></p><p><strong>Os dejamos con la entrevista, esperamos que la disfrutéis, y como siempre nos vemos al final.</strong></p><p><strong>Una vez más traemos a un invitado nuevo como siempre. Esta vez es un desarrollador que no trabaja en España y nos contará un poco acerca del tema y vamos a hablar sobre Progressive Web Apps.</strong></p><p>Así que bienvenido, José Manuel.</p><p>[José M. Pérez] Hola, muchas gracias. Pues sí, soy un desarrollador web, llevo unos diez años prácticamente haciendo web. Estudié informática en la Universidad de Alicante. Por aquel entonces la web era un desconocido. Como parte del plan de estudios estudiabas cómo hacer aplicaciones WAP. Prácticamente hacer aplicaciones móviles utilizando J2ME era lo único que había y tenías que luchar tú un poquito para encontrar alguna asignatura optativa donde se utilizara web y, bueno, hoy en día la verdad es que la situación ha cambiado bastante. Y nada, me alegro un montón de que la web sea mucho más importante que antes. Llevo cinco años trabajando en Spotify en Estocolmo trabajando haciendo web híbrida para móvil, aplicándolo a la aplicación de móvil aplicando web también a la aplicación híbrida de escritorio, utilizando web para implementar la aplicación para televisión y para PlayStation y últimamente estoy trabajando en el reproductor web. Así que nada, está súperbien porque te das cuenta de que puedes desarrollar utilizando el mismo lenguaje y prácticamente tienes acceso a cualquier plataforma. Esto viene un poco también de cuando solía trabajar en Tuenti en el sitio móvil de Tuenti, también ahí estuve haciendo cosillas para hacer una aplicación híbrida. También se integraban ciertas vistas dentro de la aplicación nativa.</p><p>Y nada, asegurándote de que la web funcionara en Nintendo DS, en PSP (PlayStation Portable), en la Blackberry 8520 que es lo que utilizaba todo el mundo. Y la verdad es que en esos momentos es cuando te das cuenta de que no puedes asumir nada, que un navegador tenga Javascript no significa que vaya a tener la capacidad de funcionar como te esperas, que haya una función declarada no significa que vaya a funcionar luego. Así que aprendí bastante a hacer lo que se llama Progressive Enhancement para asegurarte de que funciona con HTML y CSS y luego ya añadir funcionalidad con Javascript.</p><p>He sido bastante defensor de ese paradigma, aunque últimamente está siendo un poco complicado con todo el desarrollo de Javascript prácticamente basado en el lado de cliente. Esto es un poco lo que he estado haciendo últimamente.</p><p><strong>[I] Bueno, una pasada, porque la verdad es que hasta ahora, por lo menos que nos hayan comentado, no hemos tenido ningún invitado ni ninguna invitada que nos haya hablado sobre desarrollo Javascript para PSPs ni tecnologías un poco más antiguas, en este caso consolas.</strong></p><p>[J] En aquel momento yo trabajaba en Tuenti y la mayoría de usuarios eran jóvenes, se conectaban a Internet con lo que podían, normalmente utilizaban wifi, no tenían una conexión de datos. Se conectaban tarde, por la noche, prácticamente a escondidas de los padres, utilizando la consola o lo que podían tener a mano. De hecho la misma aplicación móvil funcionaba tanto en estas consolas portátiles como en la PlayStation 3 por ejemplo. Era un desafío bastante grande porque además utilizaban Netfront como navegador, no era WebKit, y daban un montón de problemas. Una de las razones por las que me interesó Spotify es porque tenían una plataforma para desarrollar aplicaciones web dentro de la aplicación de escritorio. Hoy en día es una cosa un poco más normal. Los que usamos Slack sabemos que tiene una versión web y otra de escritorio que es prácticamente lo mismo, Whatsapp también tiene una versión web y Telegram lo mismo. Se están viendo más y más ejemplos de aplicaciones que pueden correr tanto en webs como ser empaquetadas para poder instalarlas. En aquel entonces era una cosa bastante novedosa y es algo que me gustaría tratar en el tema de hoy; esta moda de Progressive Web Apps y hablar un poco de lo que teníamos antes y a lo que vienen a sustituir.</p><blockquote><p>PWA es un término de marketing, no se corresponde con ninguna versión nueva del estándar de Javascript. Muchas veces lo comparo con Web 2.0 o HTML5.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[Carmen Ansio] ¿Nos podrías explicar así resumidamente que es una Progressive Web App?</strong></p><p>[J] Pues lo primero que voy a decir es que es un término de marketing, no se corresponde con ninguna versión nueva del estándar de Javascript, ni nada parecido. Muchas veces lo comparo con Web 2.0 o HTML5. HTML5 sí era una versión nueva pero en realidad estamos hablando de todas estas APIs nuevas para poder desarrollar aplicaciones web o sitios web para los que les vamos a ir añadiendo alguna una funcionalidad.</p><p>El término Progressive Web App lo acuñó Alex Russell y Frances Berriman que eran 2 desarrolladores de Google. Hace un par de años escribieron <a href="https://infrequently.org/2015/06/progressive-apps-escaping-tabs-without-losing-our-soul/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">un post</a> y describían el término como websites que son responsive, que se parecen a aplicaciones nativas, que se puede instalar en la pantalla de inicio y que en algunos casos soportan modo offline. Es bastante interesante porque Alex estuvo hace poco explicando, <a href="https://twitter.com/slightlylate/status/879458731519389697" target="_blank" rel="noopener">en una serie de tweets</a>, cómo surgió el tema y el término PWA.</p><p>Hay mucha gente a la que no le gusta lo de Progressive Web Apps y no entiende por qué es “app” y no es “site”. En cuanto lees sobre el tema básicamente te dicen que PWA no es un término ara los desarrolladores, sino para para tu jefe. Es un término para el inversor, para el que va a hacer campaña de marketing de tu sitio. Es una forma de continuar construyendo proyectos en la web de forma abierta, que parezcan una aplicación y que normalmente tu compañía quiere hacer como aplicación nativa y no como web. Y la quieren hacer tres veces: una vez para Android, otra para iOS y otra, si pueden para Windows Phone. Al final es otra forma de decir que tenemos una serie de APIs, vamos a llamarla de alguna forma y con eso a ver si la gente se siente atraída y lo identifica como algo cool, algo novedoso, y que valga la pena verlo.</p><p>Esto lo escribieron ellos cuando estaban evaluando si tenían que tender hacia desarrollar aplicaciones para Chrome utilizando su sistema propietario, o tenían que ir más hacia un sistema más abierto, que es lo que defendían Alex y Francis. Se sentaron y estuvieron hablando sobre cómo unificar en un término esa funcionalidad de añadir a la pantalla de inicio, ServiceWorkers, notificaciones push y demás,</p><p>Cuando los desarrolladores escuchamos Progressive Web App tenemos que parar por un momento y pensar qué quiere decir, qué hay detrás. Google está promoviendo PWA y lo hace como una marca. Nosotros tenemos que verlo como un conjunto de herramientas que tenemos que tomar y aplicar a nuestras webs si así lo queremos. Muchas compañías que estaban centradas en desarrollar aplicaciones nativas ahora ven la web como una alternativa válida.</p><blockquote><p>Hay mucha gente nueva en Internet en muchos países emergentes que no quiere descargar. Las tarifas de datos son carísimas y quieren consumir contenido directamente, sin pasar por el proceso de instalación.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[I] Sí porque además hace tiempo que se demuestra que muchos usuarios se instalan cinco aplicaciones en el móvil y el resto no las abren nunca más. Son las típicas de mensajería instantánea, de redes sociales y las 2 extra de turno que se usen por el motivo que sea. Hay gente que obviamente sí usa más aplicaciones, los que estamos más en la web porque somos desarrolladores o más frikis, como queramos llamarlo. Supongo que depende un poco de cada perfil. Pero no hay que olvidar que la inmensa mayoría no somos nosotros que es todo el resto de personas que usan muy muy muy muy poquitas cosas.</strong></p><p>[J] Hasta ahora, para las empresas el objetivo era estar en las tiendas de aplicaciones y ésta era la única forma de obtener visibilidad. Si no estaban ahí el usuario no iba a poder descubrir la aplicación. Hubo un boom de aplicaciones que prácticamente no servían para nada. Para usar una aplicación tengo que pasar por todo el proceso de encontrar la aplicación, descargarla e instalarla, ocupando un espacio en el teléfono. En occidente, que hemos crecido con smartphones y tenemos buenas tarifas de datos, tenemos todavía la costumbre de estas aplicaciones. Pero hay mucha gente nueva en Internet en muchos países emergentes que no quiere descargar. Las tarifas de datos son carísimas y quieren consumir contenido directamente, sin pasar por el proceso de instalación.</p><p>Es curioso porque yo trabajo en Spotify y siempre tenemos este dilema de si debemos promocionar las aplicaciones nativas (por ejemplo descargar la aplicación de escritorio) y qué casos de uso cubre un reproductor web. ¿Puede reemplazar un reproductor web a la aplicación de escritorio? Este tipo de conversaciones las tenemos casi todos los días. Hay un montón de empresas que están viendo que tienen que ir hacia web si quieren estar donde va a estar el próximo billón (mil millones) de usuarios. Lo vemos con Twitter y Uber, que hace poco lanzó su mobile site, y con muchos otros. Habitualmente son compañías de India y de China las que más están empujando por este tipo de desarrollos.</p><p>Creo que es un buen momento para explicar que hay detrás de las PWAs y qué engloban.</p><p><strong>[I] Perfecto, cuéntanos un poco porque obviamente ya hemos dicho que no son tecnologías completamente nuevas. Es un Progressive Enhancement, que se venía haciendo desde hace ya mucho tiempo. Los que desarrollamos para web debemos tener en cuenta tecnologías más antiguas y dispositivos más antiguos para que tengan una mínima experiencia. Luego vamos sumando funcionalidades para llegar a dar a nuestros usuarios lo que creemos que es mejor para ellos, o lo que creemos que ayuda al negocio en este caso.</strong></p><p>[J] Yo creo que al final eso es lo que tenemos que hacer. Nos tenemos que centrar en qué quiere el usuario y ver cuál es la solución técnica. Muchas veces cuando aparece este tipo de tecnologías todo el mundo quiere utilizarlas. Intentan un proyecto en el que aplicarlas, cuando en realidad debería ser al contrario.</p><p>Cuando hablamos de PWAs lo hacemos principalmente de ServiceWorkers. A veces también de añadir un manifest.json y notificaciones push. ServiceWorker es un fichero Javascript que el navegador se va a descargar una vez cargada la página y es capaz de interceptar peticiones. Cualquier petición que se haga a tu dominio va a ser capturada por este ServiceWorker. Ahí ya puedes hacer lo que quieras: puedes devolver tu respuesta personalizada, puedes acceder a una caché si quiere devolver datos cacheados, etc. En resumen, es un proxy, un fichero Javascript que se pone en medio. Hay un montón de “recetas” (cookbook). Si buscáis en google encontraréis muchas cosas que puedes con ServiceWorkers.</p><p>Por ejemplo vas a tu página web o blog y quieres poder volver a ver el contenido cuando no haya conexión a internet. En este caso puedes tener un ServiceWorker que se descarga el contenido para tenerlo accesible offline. Otro ejemplo es hacer una petición para obtener una imagen y que el ServiceWorker se encargue de devolver el formato que soporta el navegador, como por ejemplo webp.</p><p>La principal característica es offline, que no la teníamos bien implementada hasta ahora. Sí que existía una tecnología llamada Application Cache que prácticamente nadie utilizaba porque era muy difícil de implementar, y que está soportada todavía en iOS. Cuando hablamos de soporte para estas APIs siempre iOS y Safari quedan un poco fuera. Ésta es la tecnología que ServiceWorker intenta reemplazar.</p><blockquote><p>Debemos hacer un uso justo y limpio de estas tecnologías o si no va a resultar en problemas y habrá que establecer límites, lo que no es bueno para nadie.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[I] De hecho ahora mismo es el único navegador moderno que no tiene ServiceWorker integrado, frente a Chrome, Firefox, Opera o Samsung Web Browser.</strong></p><p>[J] Para ser correcto, en Edge están trabajando en implementarlo y Safari ha anunciado que hay cierto interés en implementarlo en su plan de aquí a 5 años, así que con suerte llegará. También podemos hablar de la práctica empresarial de Google promoviendo PWAs frente a Apple, que no lo hace. Podemos ver que hay quizás ciertos intereses detrás de estas decisiones.</p><p>Algo que también permiten los ServiceWorkers es la sincronización background, de tal forma que no necesitas ni siquiera tener la pestaña abierta de tu página para poder acceder al contenido. Si despliegas una nueva versión de tu web puedes comprobar en un ServiceWorker instalado si hay una nueva versión y descargarte los assets. Así, una nueva petición del usuario a tu web puede usar directamente esos nuevos assets, cargando más rápido.</p><p>Un problema es que con el poder de un ServiceWorker viene también una gran responsabilidad. Mucha gente ve el hecho de hacer que una página funcione offline con una excusa para poder descargar toda la web por si acaso el usuario quiera acceder a una de las páginas. Es algo que a mí personalmente no me gusta. Por ejemplo si accedo a tu blog quizás esté interesado en ver esa página offline pero no me gustaría que utilizaras mi conexión a internet para descargar todo el contenido y todas las imágenes de tu blog para hacerlo disponible offline. Hay un conjunto de buenas prácticas como por ejemplo mostrar un botón para que el usuario pueda hacer cierto contenido offline. Debemos ser cuidadosos en este aspecto. Cuando instalas una aplicación en iOS o en Android ves cuántos MBs te estás descargando, al menos para la instalación inicial. Cuando accedes a una página web tú no lo sabes, Debemos hacer un uso justo y limpio de estas tecnologías o si no va a resultar en problemas y habrá que establecer límites, lo que no es bueno para nadie.</p><p><strong>[C] ¿Hay otros mecanismos de almacenamiento?</strong></p><p>[J] Cuando interceptas estas peticiones almacenas los datos en una caché y hay una forma de hacer que el contenido se almacene de forma temporal o persistente. El navegador considera que todo lo que descargas lo puede eliminar si lo necesita, pero hay una cierta cantidad de datos para los que puedes decir que por favor lo mantenga. Esto se calcula como un porcentaje del total de espacio disponible, teniendo en cuenta también cookies y localStorage. Antes había por ejemplo un límite de 5MB en localStorage. Ahora el navegador dedica un porcentaje del espacio de disponible en disco duro para almacenar datos. Así que en principio no hay límite, y ése es el problema. Desde una web puedes hacer una descarga grande hasta que el navegador se quede sin espacio y lance una excepción.</p><p>A la hora de implementar ServiceWorkers se puede hacer o bien a mano o utilizando una librería. Google tiene un par de librerías buenas que para incluir en proyectos: una se llama <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/sw-toolbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sw-toolbox</a> y la otra <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/sw-precache" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sw-precache</a>. Hay 3 páginas que me gustan bastante sobre ServiceWorkers. Una es una página de ejemplos que hay en googlechrome/samples y Jake Archibald, que trabaja en Google, tiene también un <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/instant-and-offline/offline-cookbook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documento muy bueno que se llama The Offline Cookbook</a>, y por último Mozilla tiene en <a href="https://serviceworke.rs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">serviceworke.rs</a> una lista de diferentes estrategias a la hora de implementar ServiceWorkers.</p><p><strong>[I] Pues luego las anotamos y las dejamos en el programa. Algo que has mencionado son las Push Notifications, que no sé si van directamente ligadas con el hecho de usar una PWA, pero que es algo que va de la mano. Por ejemplo utilizando websockets, obtener información en directo y que vas recopilando en función de cuándo la envías desde un servidor y el usuario va recibiendo ese feedback.</strong></p><p>[J] Todo esto se basa en ServiceWorkers porque al final necesitas tener algo corriendo. Si tu página no está en primer plano tienes que tener un ServiceWorker que es lo que se va a quedar ejecutándose cuando el usuario cierra esa ventana o esa pestaña. Las notificaciones push son la misma notificación push que se ve normalmente en una aplicación. Va por otra vía pero al final la parte visual es exactamente igual.</p><p>Las notificaciones push eran una de las razones principales por las que las empresas querían hacer aplicación nativa. Una de las razones era el descubrir esa aplicación, para lo cual necesitabas hacer una aplicación nativa y ponerla en la tienda, la segunda era poder tener notificaciones push. Es útil para que el usuario vuelva a tu aplicación y no es suficiente con que el usuario instale la aplicación. Prácticamente hoy tenemos acceso a todo lo que tiene acceso una aplicación nativa.</p><p><strong>[I] Hay ciertas APIs que de momento funcionan ahí ahí. Hablamos con tecnologías web sin tener algo de por medio como pueda ser PhoneGap o Ionic. Nosotros desarrollamos una plataforma con WebRTC y tuvimos un montón de problemas para implementarlo porque obviamente no está soportado en varios navegadores. Hasta Edge 14 ó 15 no funcionaba. Obviamente Internet Explorer tampoco. Safari no funcionaba hasta hace muy poquito o han dicho que lo van a implementar en la siguiente versión del sistema operativo y obviamente funcionaba en Chrome. Aunque Chrome es una gran mayoría en uso a nivel mundial no hay que olvidar que hay muchos otros usuarios que no usan Chrome.</strong></p><p>[J] Sí, y luego todos aquellos que usen iPhone están fuera de momento de las PWAs. No es posible añadir una web a la pantalla de inicio y abrirlo a pantalla completa. Como decía, es un tema de marketing. PWA no deja de ser una web de toda la vida a la que le hemos añadido una funcionalidad extra para ponerlo en la pantalla de inicio y que no se abra el navegador, y soporte offline.</p><blockquote><p>ServiceWorker es un progressive enhancement, no puedes suponer que va a estar ahí.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[C] Hablando de ese soporte offline y de ServiceWorkers, he leído el término “offline first”. ¿Nos podías comentar un poco cómo funciona?</strong></p><p>[J] Es gracioso porque estaba escuchando <a href="http://wecodesignpodcast.com/2017/07/04/mobile-first/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">el podcast que hicisteis con Diana sobre Mobile First</a>. A veces nos hablan de offline first, a veces nos hablan de mobile first y a veces de content first cuando se habla sobre response design. Al final como desarrollador dices ¿qué tengo que hacer?</p><p>La idea de offline first está muy bien, no dar nada por hecho, que tu web pueda funcionar sin conexión a internet. Pero a la hora de implementarlo viene la parte difícil porque al introducir ServiceWorkers normalmente introduces el cacheo de fichero Javascript y también un sistema de templates. Para esto funciona muy bien utilizar librerías como Preact o Vue, donde tienes los templates y tienes el JS y no tienes nada server-side. Esto es muy fácil de cachear. También offline se podía conseguir hasta ahora utilizando unas buenas cabeceras de respuesta. Muchas veces no hace falta utilizar ServiceWorkers si quieres que tu página siga funcionando o que no repitas una request. Es cuestión de decirle al navegador que cachee el contenido durante más tiempo. Cuando hablan de offline first se entiende que no hay que asumir cuáles son las condiciones de la red. Supón que no hay red, ¿cómo va a comportarse tu página?</p><p>Uno de las características de ServiceWorkers es que la primera vez que visitas una página, ésta no se va a renderizar utilizando ServiceWorkers. El SW se añade después, lo descarga el navegador y sólo funciona para las siguientes peticiones. Es un progressive enhancement, no puedes suponer que el Service Worker va a estar ahí. Para que tu contenido sea offline primero tienes que visitar la web y tienes que poder cargar este ServiceWorker, que descargará el contenido. Me gusta offline first, igual que se suele pensar sobre qué pasaría si no se pudiera descargar o ejecutar Javascript, en cuyo caso habría que hacer, por ejemplo, Server Side Rendering. O ¿qué pasaría si el usuario tiene problemas de accesibilidad, qué va a ocurrir con el contenido, va a ser leído por lectores de accesibilidad? Todo esto al final va sumando y tenemos que pensar en una experiencia buena para que luego le añadamos funcionalidad. Y offline first no deja de ser otra más. Cuesta mucho decidir qué va primero ¿contenido, mobile, offline? Son metodologías diferentes. Como desarrolladores a veces estamos cansados, hay un poco de fatiga con todo lo que sale nuevo y hay que leerlo e intentar decir “vale, esto lo sitúo aquí y forma parte de mis herramientas para en algún momento determinado poder aplicarlas”.</p><p><strong>[I] Hay una página web de una desarrolladora que se llama [inaudible] que tiene un botoncito para hacer offline un post determinado, como decías tú al principio “quiero que este post en concreto, que me interesa escuchar a lo mejor cuando no tenga conexión”, pues lo guarda y te cachea las imágenes y todo lo que tiene ese post. Ella graba con voz cada uno de los artículos que escribe y deja que los escuches de forma offline si quieres. Creo que es una manera muy buena para dejar que el usuario decida si quiere descargar ese episodio o en este caso un artículo y que lo pueda leer cuando va en el metro sin conexión. No nos olvidemos que aunque vivimos en grandes ciudades en muchísimas ocasiones tenemos eso que llaman Lo-Fi. No tienes conexión suficiente porque estás dentro de un túnel y durante un período de tiempo determinado tienes una conexión realmente mala o directamente ninguna.</strong></p><p>[J] Sí, también lo llaman Lie-Fi, como que es un poco de mentira. Te dice que tiene wi-fi pero intenta descargar cosas por la wi-fi y no acaba de traerse nada. Yo creo que ése es un buen caso de uso. Jake Archibald, que es uno de los ingenieros de Google que ha estado dando presentaciones sobre esto, tiene una PWA para ver artículos de Wikipedia. Y tiene un botón para descargar un artículo y poder leerlo luego. Creo que esa funcionalidad es muy buena. Yo tengo un blog y no uso JS para nada, excepto para un SW. Y si te quedas sin conexión puedes leer el post que estabas leyendo más un par de enlaces más que todo que tengo arriba en el menú. Y ya está, no necesitas nada más. Está muy bien darle al usuario la posibilidad de que si quieren puedan descargar el contenido online. Me parece súper bien y creo que ése es el tipo de casos de uso que tenemos que intentar cubrir, y no intentar usarlo para todo sólo porque es nuevo.</p><blockquote><p>Mucha gente cree que esto de las PWA es sólo para sitios web grandes o de empresas importantes. En realidad puedes añadir un SW y manifest a cualquier web.</p></blockquote><p><strong>[I] Antes has hablado del Manifest. Aunque ya sabemos que es un JSON y que da ciertas funcionalidades como decir “bájate este archivo, baja este otro”. ¿Para qué otras cosas se puede utilizar el Manifest?</strong></p><p>[J] Yo creo que estaban un poco hartos de añadir cabeceras “meta” dentro dentro de las páginas y decidieron crear un fichero donde definir un JSON con un montón de información que queremos tener para esta integración. En Google lo llaman A2HS (Add to Home Screen) y es lo que va a utilizar el sistema operativo móvil para poder abrir la aplicación. Tú le dices con qué orientación quieres abrirla y qué iconos quieres utilizar. Cuando implementas una PWA puedes comprobar dentro de tu código si está corriendo en modo aplicación (lanzada desde la pantalla de inicio) o si está corriendo dentro del navegador, utilizando display-mode. Si es standalone significa que está instalada y corriendo desde la pantalla de inicio. Está bien para analytics, para saber cuánta gente ha instalado la aplicación y la está utilizando así. También puedes utilizarlo para media-queries, para poder cambiar ligeramente en el estilo de la página dependiendo de si lo has lanzado desde la pantalla de inicio o no. Uno de los casos de uso sería mostrar botones de navegación cuando lo lanzas en fullscreen.</p><p>Mucha gente cree que esto de las PWA es sólo para sitios web grandes o de empresas importantes. En realidad puedes añadir un SW y manifest a cualquier web. Hay directorios de PWAs (por ejemplo <a href="https://pwa-directory.appspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PWA Directory</a> o <a href="https://pwa.rocks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PWA Rocks</a>) a poder descubrir dentro de Bing PWAs y te va a ofrecer la posibilidad de instalarlas. Es una especie de store pero en lugar de tú publicar ahí, Microsoft va a utilizar el mismo crawler que usan para Bing y va a poder mostrar ahí directamente la web.</p><p>No creo que las PWAs estén restringidas a webs grandes y pienso que todo el mundo debería probarlas. Los desarrolladores deberíamos hacer pruebas con nuestras webs. Cuando empecé a utilizar ServiceWorkers me di cabezazos contra el ordenador porque las herramientas de desarrollo no estaban muy desarrolladas, valga la redundancia. Cuando hacía una petición no sabía si la respuesta estaba viniendo del ServiceWorker o de verdad estaba sirviendo el fichero del servidor. Teníasque buscar por ahí un menú había muy oculto para activar la opción de que todas las peticiones dentro de localhost fueran directamente al fichero y que no se cacheen. Esto ha mejorado muchísimo.</p><p>Tenemos muchas estrategias sobre cómo hacer versionado de cachés. Cuando almacenas en ServiceWorker estás almacenando en la memoria del navegador. Si haces cambios en tu web y lanzas una nueva versión y versionas de la misma forma que versionas otros scripts, deberías ser un buen ciudadano, acceder a la versión previa que tenías cacheada y eliminarla del navegador. Si no al final vas a acumular un montón de bundles de Javascript o templates que ya no se necesitan.</p><p>Sé que hay alguna pregunta sobre utilizar PWAs con React, Vue y otras librerías. Si habéis utilizado alguna vez Create React App, que es una especie de boilerplate para crear aplicaciones React, también existe la posibilidad de utilizar estas mismas herramientas para crear PWAs. Create React App va a crear directamente por defecto una PWAs y, si utilizáis Preact, lanzaron su CLI para crearlas con Preact, y Vue también tiene su CLI con el que se generan PWAs por defecto.</p><p><strong>[C] Como has comentado antes, Apple no tiene soporte para para PWAs. ¿Ves un poco de guerra entre Google y Apple?</strong></p><p>[J] A veces parece que sí, al igual que Internet Explorer no implementaba nada nuevo en su navegador y entonces salió Firefox que implementaba todo. Mucha gente se pasó a Firefox y posteriormente a Chrome. Siempre existe esta guerra de navegadores y de las empresas que hay detrás. Me gusta mucho Google, que está empujando por estos estándares. Si desarrollamos PWAs el usuario no necesitará ir a la Store a descargarse nada, y ahora mismo tanto puede Google com oApple se llevan un porcentaje cuando descargas aplicaciones de pago y también de los pagos in-app. Al principio Apple sólo ofrecía herramientas web para desarrollar “aplicaciones” para iPhone, no existía nada para hacer una aplicación nativa. Todo giraba en torno a crear webs que tuviera el mismo look&amp;feel. Luego descubrieron que ahí es donde estaba el negocio cuando empezaron a proporcionar estas herramientas para desarrollar aplicaciones nativas. Es difícil que vayas a ir en contra de tu principal fuente de ingresos. Google parece que tienen los ingresos más diversificados. Al confiar en una plataforma de anuncios Google se va a llevar dinero por anuncio, que también se muestran en la web (eg PWA).</p><p>Hay mucho trabajo para estandarizar estas APIs, implementarlas de una forma buena idea y de releasearlas. Pero estoy seguro de que también hay decisiones de negocio. Google se ha posicionado claramente hacia promover esta serie de APIs, hacen workshops en varios sitios del mundo explicando cómo usarlas, muestran cómo diferentes webs están implementando esta funcionalidad (qué problemas tenían de rendimiento, cómo han añadido PWAs y han ido mejorando, cuáles son las métricas que se ha movido como mayor retención de usuarios o más páginas vistas). Trabajan codo con codo con empresas grandes como Flipkart - el “Amazon” de India - o ele.me, que es una empresa muy grande de China de venta de comida online.</p><p>Apple va un poco por su cuenta. Es verdad que Safari está cambiando, implementando mucha funcionalidad que faltaba, pero da la sensación de que son reacios a implementar PWAs. Para entender mejor las razones pienso que es útil pensar cómo puede afectar a las fuentes de ingresos que los desarrolladores migren a web. Las empresas tienen un número limitado de trabajadores y muchas cosas que quieren hacer. Tienen que priorizar unas frente a otras y por lo que sea no están priorizando los ServiceWorkers y toda la funcionalidad para añadir webs a pantalla de inicio para ejecutarlas de forma standalone.</p><p><strong>[I] Yo creo que en este caso Apple a lo mejor no tiene publicidad directa como hace Google, y le da un poco más igual. Como tiene tantísimos beneficios a través de la App Store perder ese mercado, que es inmenso, es un peligro obviamente para ellos. Ahora mismo los que últimamente llegan tarde son Edge y Safari (Edge está mejorando un montón pero aún quedan algunas cosillas) y, en mi opinión, está claro por qué no lo están implementando. Con la salida de Technology Preview, que es la versión de desarrollador, sí está cambiando, pero le queda mucho para que, como pasa con Firefox y Chrome, se actualicen de forma constante.</strong></p><p>[J] También está la restricción de que no puedes correr ningún navegador con otro motor. Así que aunque tú instales Chrome o Firefox en iPhone estás corriendo Webkit por detrás, el motor de Safari. Puedes personalizar la experiencia alrededor del navegador pero no implementar PWAs. Eso es una decisión de negocio, y ahí no hay ninguna excusa. No puedes decir “queremos hacer el entorno más seguro”. Podrían utilizar el proceso de envío y revisión de aplicaciones y que tú pudieras ofrecer un motor de renderizado diferente. Es su ecosistema y controlan lo que ofrecen a los usuarios. El target de usuarios es diferente. Por ejemplo, en India o China el mercado de iOS es bastante más pequeño que en otros países de nuestro alrededor. Cada empresa juega sus cartas.</p><p>Como desarrolladores lo tenemos que ver como una funcionalidad añadida. Si lo soporta el navegador podemos utilizarlo y si no lo soporta, como hemos hecho bien nuestro trabajo, va a dar lo mismo porque el usuario va a poder disfrutar de nuestra web. Son APIs para mejorar nuestra web pero nunca tenemos que asumir que están ahí. Y lo bueno de ServiceWorker es que no se puede asumir su soporte, dado que la primera vez que carga la página no se puede utilizar.</p><p><strong>[I] Si te parece pasamos las preguntas que nos han dejado por Twitter. Pregunta Manuel si has tocado Vue para las PWAs o si sabes algún recurso sobre ServiceWorkers y notificaciones push en castellano.</strong></p><p>[J] No he usado Vue todavía. He estado leyendo sobre Vue pero me he enfocado más en React, que lo estoy utilizando en un proyecto grande, y probando Preact e Inferno por cuestiones de tamaño. Afortunadamente no necesitamos utilizar ninguna de estas librerías para crear PWAs. Como dije, mi blog sólo utiliza Javascript para crear un ServiceWorker y tener contenido offline. Las PWAs no requieren frameworks ni librerías específicos. Ni siquiera tienen que ser una SPA.</p><p>Recomiendo utilizar Vue CLI para crear PWAs con Vue. Habrán tomado algunas decisiones por ti, abstrayéndote para bien o para mal de los detalles de implementación, pero te servirá para crear un esqueleto para una aplicación.</p><p>Sobre recursos en español hay una web que se llama “<a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/codelabs/your-first-pwapp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tu primera Progressive Web App</a>” y la escribió Pete LePage, que es un desarrollador de Google. Es una traducción al español de la documentación oficial. Es un muy buen recurso y es más detallado que otros artículos que se pueden encuentran en español en Internet.</p><p><strong>[I] Fernando nos pregunta cómo encajan con las PWAs Que, React y Angular.</strong></p><p>[J] Recomiendo que cada uno escoja el framework/librería con la que se sientan más a gusto. Todas estas soluciones son similares y se pueden crear PWAs con ellas.</p><p><strong>[I] Fernando nos deja una segunda pregunta. Quiere saber si se adaptan los servicios workers correctamente a las aplicaciones híbridas Ionic o PhoneGap.</strong></p><p>[J] Es una buena pregunta. Es difícil saber dónde está la frontera entre entrar desarrollando una web que luego va a correr en una WebView, como en el caso de PhoneGap o Ionic. También hay alternativas nativas como ReactNative o NativeScript. Si estás desarrollando en iOS no vas a tener soporte para ServiceWorker independientemente de si es el navegador o si es una WebView porque no deja de ser el mismo navegador; no vas a tener soporte.</p><p>En el caso de Android no estoy seguro de cómo funcionan los ServiceWorkers dentro de las WebViews. Por ejemplo, quizás se cachea, quizás se mantiene en memoria sólo para esa WebView específica. No he llegado a trabajar con PWAs dentro de una aplicación híbrida.</p><p><strong>[C] Vamos a pasar a la tanda de preguntas que hemos. Manuel pregunta si puedes recomendar algún libro que hable sobre PWAs.</strong></p><p>[J] Hasta ahora no conocía ningún libro sobre PWAs y me he puesto a buscar. Casualmente acaba de salir un libro que está en Early Release y se llama “<a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920052067.do" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Building Progressive Web Apps: Bringing the Power of Native to the Browser</a>” de O’Reilly. El autor creó también una librería que utilicé para un proyecto llamada “annyang” para hacer reconocimiento de voz.</p><p>Es más habitual encontrar información sobre PWAs en posts (sobre todo los de Developer Relations de Google) y más tarde llegan a libros.</p><p><strong>[C] A Manuel le gustaría saber en qué orden se comienza a desarrollar este tipo de aplicaciones.</strong></p><p>[J] Primero haz una web bien y luego mejórala. Considera PWA como un añadido. No intentes utilizar PWAs desde el principio o como una forma de solucionar problemas. Por ejemplo, si tienes problemas de performance no es buena idea que intentes solucionarlos con PWAs diciendo “sí, esto cacheo con un ServiceWorker y ya está”. Hay otras cosas que vas a tener que mirar antes.</p><p>Busca otras soluciones como por ejemplo hacer split del bundle: en lugar de mandar 1MB manda 200kB y luego carga el resto de forma asíncrona. No veas PWAs como el martillo y cualquier problema como un clavo.</p><p><strong>[C] David nos hace la última pregunta. Está interesado en saber que si el cliente sigue requiriendo una alternativa en forma de aplicación para tenerla en las stores, ¿qué tecnología utilizarías? ¿Cordova con React? ¿React Native?</strong></p><p>Es un problema porque aunque tengas una PWA es probable que te digan que la quieren ver en la tienda. Hay dos alternativas. Puedes implementar una aplicación híbrida con Cordova o Ionic 2, que utiliza Angular, y la empaquetas dentro de un navegador. También puedes utilizar lo último de lo último y utilizar React Native. En este caso tienes que reescribir la vista porque los componentes van a ser diferentes. Lo bueno es que, si la has estructurado bien, puedes reutilizar toda la parte de negocio (por ejemplo Redux). Esta opción es buena si quieres tener una aplicación con un muy buen rendimiento. También existe NativeScript, que se puede utilizar con Preact.</p><p>Independientemente de la solución trata de desacoplar el código. Intenta tener claro qué parte pertenece a la vista y cuál es lógica de negocio. Mueve código estable a una API, de forma que dé igual cuál sea la interfaz que consume los datos. Esto te permite hacer cambios tanto en la API (por ejemplo reescribiéndola en otro lenguaje) como el front (por ejemplo, crear un nuevo cliente para otra plataforma o utilizar una librería diferente).</p><p>Lo que usas hoy se va a quedar “anticuado” en un par de años, así que siempre intenta modularizar el código y optimiza para el mantenimiento y migración del código más que esforzarse en acoplar tu proyecto demasiado con un framework.</p><p><strong>[I] Si te parece con esto cerramos las preguntas de Twitter y pasamos a la más difícil. Dinos cómo ves la web dentro de 5 ó 10 años.</strong></p><p>[J] Pues es una pregunta difícil. Pienso en el desarrollo de los móviles y es impensable lo que hacíamos hace cinco años comparado con lo que hacemos ahora. Hace poco estuve en una charla donde un ponente dijo que somos la última generación que sabrá lo que es un navegador y creo que el futuro de la web es olvidarse del concepto “navegador”, o por lo menos como la única forma de consumir contenidos en la web.</p><p>La web se integra ahora mismo en móviles utilizando PWAs, pero también como una Webview en una aplicación nativa. Tenemos Chrome OS como el mejor ejemplo de cómo ejecutar sitios web que funcionan como aplicaciones. Y tenemos también ejemplos como AMP de Google donde generas contenido que luego va a estar directamente embebido dentro del buscador, o Instant Articles para integrar contenido en Facebook, y Apple News.</p><p>En mi trabajo me doy cuenta de que muchas veces la web se utiliza como un gran backend. Por ejemplo, Google indexa el contenido de Spotify y utilizando la web en la que trabajo (open.spotify.com), extrayendo metadatos para su buscador, que se muestran en un lateral al buscar artistas. También se utiliza para Google Home o Alexa de Amazon para su integración con web. Y de forma similar, cuando compartes en Facebook o Twitter, sus bots utilizan metadatos extraídos de la página para mostrar una previsualización.</p><p>Tenemos que dejar de pensar que hacemos webs que sólo van a ser consumidas a través de un navegador. Creamos contenido utilizando herramientas web pero no tenemos ningún control sobre dónde se van a visualizar. Un ejemplo es WebVR, donde es difícil controlar el entorno, y no existe el concepto de “página”.</p><p>Tenemos que mirar más allá, pensar en nuevas interfaces y cuál va a ser el papel de la web ahí y olvidarse de controlar en entorno. Cuando llegaron los móviles con navegador fue un desafío crear webs. ¿Un sitio aparte? ¿Responsive? Este problema es fácil comparado con lo que viene ahora.</p><p><strong>[C] ¡Sí que está difícil saber lo que vendrá! Si te parece entramos en las ráfagas, y aquí va la primera. Dinos alguien que te haya inspirado.</strong></p><p>Me gustaría mencionar gente con la que he trabajado y me ha inspirado. Me gustó mucho trabajar en Tuenti con Alberto Grajera (@manquismo) que ahora está en Cabify, Davide Mendolia (@davideme) que está en Karumi, y Felipe Ribeiro (@felipernb) con quien trabajo en Spotify. Son desarrolladores que solían hacer web, aunque algunos hacen ahora móvil, y te recuerdan qué es lo importante cuando estás trabajando. La toma de requisitos, evaluar el problema con una mente ingenieril y no dejarse llevar por modas (por ejemplo últimas librerías). A todos nos gusta utilizar lo último pero tenemos que anteponer el hecho de que hay un usuario detrás, que necesita ese proyecto a tiempo y que funcione bien. Hay una empresa que te está pagando por hacer el trabajo, y va a haber un compañero que va a entrar a tu equipo y tiene que heredar o trabajar contigo en ese código. Estas 3 personas me han ayudado mucho a centrarme en lo que de verdad es importante.</p><p>Hay gente conocida del mundo web que me gusta seguir, y que me han inspirado de una forma diferente. Steve Souders fue quien hizo reverse engineering de cómo el navegador hacía peticiones y gestionaba las dependencias entre ellas. Fue quien puso las bases de lo que hoy se conoce como WPO (Optimización de rendimiento web).</p><p>Nicholas C. Zakas, que trabaja en Yahoo, hablaba sobre patrones para escribir Javascript mantenible. Stoyan Stefanov, que trabaja en Facebook, es otro track de Javascript. Algunos más “recientes” son Addy Osmani, que es un devrel de Google que da muchas charlas muy entretenidas. Y por último Dan Abramos, que quien haya trabajado con Redux sabrá que es quien responde cualquier pregunta sobre el tema, y trabaja en Facebook.</p><p><strong>[I] Los dejamos todos anotados para que la gente conozca a gente nueva, aprenda cosas nuevas y amplíe sus horizontes. Recomiéndanos ahora un recurso, una página web o un blog que consideres imprescindible.</strong></p><p>No podía elegir sólo uno, así que he escogido varios. Me gustan mucho las newsletter y estoy suscrito a Frontend Focus y Javascript Weekly, que comparten muchos enlaces a posts y vídeos de conferencias.</p><p>Me gusta mucho ver vídeos de charlas, como por ejemplo los de las JSConf. Esta conferencia es de las principales en JS, las entradas son caras, pero publican todos los vídeos en Youtube, así que es un buen recurso para ponerse al día. Google IO, el evento anual de Google, publican muchos vídeos de sus charlas. Hace un par de meses fue la edición de 2017 y ya están subidos.</p><p>Hay un par de webs que visito bastante: CSSTricks y Smashing Magazine, que hablan sobre frontend en general.</p><p>Un buen libro es “High Performance Browser Networking” de Ilya Grigorik, que es un ingeniero De Google. Te explica todo el stack, qué ocurre cuando se hace una petición y todos los puntos en los que podemos trabajar para mejorar el rendimiento de una web.</p><p><strong>[I] Perfecto. Igualmente lo dejamos apuntado para que la gente los pueda ver.</strong></p><p><strong>[C] Recomiéndanos ahora a un invitado o invitada a quien te gustaría que invitásemos al programa.</strong></p><p>[J] Jaume Sanchez Elias (@thespite en Twitter) es un chico que hace WebGL, WebVR y cosas muy chulas. Hace poco coincidí con él en una charla y me encantó conocerlo. Es muy enriquecedor cuando conoces a gente puntera que es capaz de inspirar tanto a los desarrolladores web. Es impresionante lo que puede conseguir con estas herramientas. Jaume hace que parezca fácil, pero en realidad hay mucho trabajo detrás. Me gustaría escuchar a Jaume hablar de estos temas.</p><p><strong>[I] Perfecto, pues le haremos llegar desde aquí la invitación. Por último recomiéndanos un tema que te gustaría tratar en el programa.</strong></p><p>[J] Soy un enamorado de mejorar la performance. Me gustaría saber si le preocupa a los desarrolladores, si son capaces de convencer a la gente de producto de que es algo a lo que hay que dedicarle tiempo, y si se ve como una feature más. Cuáles son los casos prácticos, si han introducido alguna mejora que se tradujera en más usuarios u otras métricas. Echo en falta ejemplos, sobre todo de empresas españolas, donde se vean mejoras de rendimiento que hayan movido métricas importantes para la empresa.</p><p><strong>[I] Muy bien, pues con esto cerramos el programa. La verdad es que ha sido un verdadero placer tenerte con nosotros. Hemos obtenido un montón de información y sobre temas útiles para que a la gente le pique el gusanillo y se ponga a investigar y a realmente implementarlo.</strong></p><p>[J] Lo divertido es que es fácil jugar con nuestras webs, e inspeccionar el código de cualquier web, aprendiendo de cómo han aplicado otros PWA.</p><p><strong>[C] Muchísimas gracias José Manuel por haber aceptado nuestra invitación.</strong></p><p>[J] A vosotros, un honor.</p><p><strong>[I] Muchas gracias.</strong></p><p>[Música] Recomendaciones.

It was truly international, with all talks delivered in English (something unusual in Spain) and 250 attendees from 25+ countries.</p><p>The most impressive is that <strong>it was arranged by 2 Spanish expats who form the company <a href="https://limenius.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Limenius</a>, based in Munich</strong>. <a href="https://twitter.com/nacmartin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nacho</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/vicqr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Victoria</a> did an impressive job, putting together a top-level conference with a great line-up and contents. They managed to prove that its possible to arrange a good conference in a well-communicated location like Alicante, with good weather and interesting attractions, while making it affordable (the regular tickets for the talks were 99).</p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto,f_auto,c_scale/v1510331531/react-alicante-nacho-martin_wzczdx.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px" alt="Nacho Martín speaking at React Alicante"> <small class="caption">Nacho Martín speaking at React Alicante</small></p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto,f_auto,c_scale/v1510331531/react-alicante-flavio-corpa_tg37vj.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px" alt="Flavio Corpa during his talk"> <small class="caption">Flavio Corpa during his talk</small></p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto,f_auto,c_scale/v1510331531/react-alicante-overview_hncowx.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px" alt="Overview of React Alicante"> <small class="caption">General overview of the full room</small></p><p>There were several talks touching on style guides and the difficult world of creating UI components that can be customisable in options and theming. Other topics were forms, CSS in JS, Redux/Mobx, code splitting, GraphQL, and React Native.</p><p>They covered pretty well the current ecosystem of tools when working with React, and they shared learnings that can be applied to our daily jobs.</p><p>Do you want more details about the talks?

It goes through all the stages from pre-BEM, BEM, CSS modules and JSS (CSS in JS).</p><p>Andrey explains how CSS in JS is not such a bad idea, the same way JSX broke the separation of concerns by getting closer to the components logic.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Gmail and Google Maps in the history of CSS with <a href="https://twitter.com/okonetchnikov?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@okonetchnikov</a> at <a href="https://twitter.com/ReactAlicante?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@ReactAlicante</a> <a href="https://t.co/3zfpAp2WqS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pic.twitter.com/3zfpAp2WqS</a></p>&mdash; Karl Horky (@karlhorky) <a href="https://twitter.com/karlhorky/status/913683058594902017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">29 September 2017</a></blockquote><p>At the end, he talks about the ecosystem of tools to help us either inlining CSS in JS or creating optimised CSS rules that reduce code duplication. In short, it lets machines do what they are best at.</p><p>The talk covers a topic that is really hot at the moment. In fact several other talks also brought up the idea of moving the styles within the components to help with maintainability, theming and critical css rendering. If you like these topics I recommend you to check <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT4D_DioYC8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark Dalgleishs talk at CSSConf EU 2017</a>.</p><h4 id="React-gt-gt-Redux-a-development-workflow-by-Braulio-Diez"><a href="#React-gt-gt-Redux-a-development-workflow-by-Braulio-Diez" class="headerlink" title="React &gt;&gt; Redux a development workflow by Braulio Diez"></a>React &gt;&gt; Redux a development workflow by <a href="https://twitter.com/braulio_sl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Braulio Diez</a></h4><p>Braulio was really energetic and gave a talk about how you might not always need Redux when working with React. I couldn’t find tweets nor slides from the talk, so I’ll wait for the videos to add more content.</p><h4 id="React-Storybook-Design-Develop-Document-and-Debug-your-React-UI-components-by-Marie-Laure-Thuret-Slides"><a href="#React-Storybook-Design-Develop-Document-and-Debug-your-React-UI-components-by-Marie-Laure-Thuret-Slides" class="headerlink" title="React-Storybook: Design, Develop, Document and Debug your React UI components by Marie-Laure Thuret - Slides"></a>React-Storybook: Design, Develop, Document and Debug your React UI components by <a href="https://twitter.com/mlthuret" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marie-Laure Thuret</a> - <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/mlthuret/storybook-dev-design-debug-and-document-your-ui-components" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slides</a></h4><p>I loved this talk! Do you know that feeling when you are listening someone explaining all your current pains and provides you with great solutions? That’s how I felt.</p><p>Not only did she talked about how to use StoryBook, but also how it was the source of truth and a communication tool with designers and between developers. You send a PR that makes a change in a component? Link directly to the story for that component so the reviewer sees the result without having to browse through the site.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/mlthuret?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@mlthuret</a> talking about documentation and Visual Regression Testing with StoryBook <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ReactAlicante?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#ReactAlicante</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NiceTalk?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#NiceTalk</a> <a href="https://t.co/3trWkSmlIK" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pic.twitter.com/3trWkSmlIK</a></p>&mdash; Gabriel Garcia Seco (@GGarciaSeco10) <a href="https://twitter.com/GGarciaSeco10/status/913712092900843521?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">29 September 2017</a></blockquote><p>I was recently looking for tools to do visual regression testing to catch CSS issues, but in the end we decided to skip it. I liked that Marie-Laure talked about this and demoed <a href="https://loki.js.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Loki</a>, which I didnt know about, that integrates with StoryBook and provides visual diffing. It looked easy to use and a great complement to unit tests and snapshot tests for components.</p><h4 id="A-practical-guide-to-Redux-Form-by-Erik-Rasmussen-Slides-and-Code"><a href="#A-practical-guide-to-Redux-Form-by-Erik-Rasmussen-Slides-and-Code" class="headerlink" title="A practical guide to Redux Form by Erik Rasmussen - Slides and Code"></a>A practical guide to Redux Form by <a href="https://twitter.com/erikras" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Erik Rasmussen</a> - <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/erikras/a-practical-guide-to-redux-form" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slides</a> and <a href="//github.com/erikras/reactalicante2017">Code</a></h4><p>Im fortunate that I dont have to deal with forms that often. If I ever have to do it with React, I think I would go for <a href="https://redux-form.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Redux Form</a>.</p><p>Creating a form involves having multiple fields with a similar logic. It’s easy to end up duplicating code and dealing with unmaintainable code that only works for a given form. Redux Form helps removing boilerplate code and integrates beautifully with Redux.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">.<a href="https://twitter.com/erikras?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@erikras</a> on the difficulties of using forms, including use in environments with unidirectional data flow such as React. <a href="https://t.co/qSteZV458r" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pic.twitter.com/qSteZV458r</a></p>&mdash; Karl Horky (@karlhorky) <a href="https://twitter.com/karlhorky/status/913717121032519681?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">29 September 2017</a></blockquote><p>Erik did a ver smooth live demo, going from a simple form as we would implement it, and showing how to add more functionality through Redux Form while refactoring the code.</p><p>I personally love it when I see examples of Higher-Order Components that simplify the code. It’s usually not obvious how they can solve some patterns, and it’s one of the most powerful features of functional programming applied to React.</p><h4 id="React-Native-Case-study-From-zero-to-a-super-hero-app-by-Ferran-Negre-Slides"><a href="#React-Native-Case-study-From-zero-to-a-super-hero-app-by-Ferran-Negre-Slides" class="headerlink" title="React Native  Case study: From zero to a super hero app by Ferran Negre - Slides"></a>React Native Case study: From zero to a super hero app by <a href="https://twitter.com/ferrannp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ferran Negre</a> - <a href="https://ferrannp.github.io/slides/react-native-zero-to-superhero/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slides</a></h4><p>Ferran ent through some features that most mobile applications need to deal with, and explained the challenges to implement them using React Native. He applied it to an application he had developed to follow TV Series (it reminded me to <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ishows-tv-powered-by-trakt-tv/id992387872" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iShows</a>).</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So happy to have talked in front of such a huge audience (250) in the sunny and beautiful Alicante! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/reactnative?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#reactnative</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/react?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#react</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/ReactAlicante?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@ReactAlicante</a> <a href="https://t.co/crlrB1ungY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pic.twitter.com/crlrB1ungY</a></p>&mdash; Ferran Negre (@ferrannp) <a href="https://twitter.com/ferrannp/status/913774705521430529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">29 September 2017</a></blockquote><p>It turns out developing React Native applications is not as straightforward as it seems, especially if you want to mimic exactly how a native application behaves in some cases. Some examples are the lack of automatic refresh of the app when changing the system language, or doing data synchronisation when the app is in the background. Ferran has been documenting lots of tips to solve this issues on his <a href="https://medium.com/@ferrannp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medium</a>, and contributed with Java bridges to expose native functionality to React.</p><h4 id="Mutable-or-Immutable-Lets-do-both-by-Mattia-Manzati-Slides"><a href="#Mutable-or-Immutable-Lets-do-both-by-Mattia-Manzati-Slides" class="headerlink" title="Mutable or Immutable?

I like how he shows that even though you might be tempted to eject, it might be better to find an alternative that keeps you using create-react-app and getting its updates.</p><p>I love that the talk is supported by <a href="https://medium.com/@tuchk4/why-i-love-create-react-app-e63b1be689a3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a write up on Medium</a>, which makes it easily digestible for someone that doesnt have time to go through the video.</p><h4 id="Custom-CSS-is-the-path-to-inconsistent-UI-by-Artem-Sapegin-Slides"><a href="#Custom-CSS-is-the-path-to-inconsistent-UI-by-Artem-Sapegin-Slides" class="headerlink" title="Custom CSS is the path to inconsistent UI by Artem Sapegin - Slides"></a>Custom CSS is the path to inconsistent UI by <a href="https://twitter.com/iamsapegin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Artem Sapegin</a> - <a href="https://sapegin.github.io/slides/inconsistent-styles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slides</a></h4><p>The title of this lightning talk is a strong statement, and Artem explains during his talk that we should avoid magic numbers and use components to solve typography and spacing in CSS.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">.<a href="https://twitter.com/iamsapegin?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@iamsapegin</a> about standard UI design and solutions for this at <a href="https://twitter.com/ReactAlicante?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@ReactAlicante</a> <a href="https://t.co/eB5NDnHsme" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pic.twitter.com/eB5NDnHsme</a></p>&mdash; Karl Horky (@karlhorky) <a href="https://twitter.com/karlhorky/status/913745863297683456?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">29 September 2017</a></blockquote><p>To solve spacing specifically he developed <a href="https://github.com/sapegin/react-spaceman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">react-spaceman</a> (see <a href="https://sapegin.github.io/react-spaceman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the demo</a>), inspired by <a href="https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/space-in-design-systems-188bcbae0d62" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nathan Curtis’ framework</a>.</p><p>Artem is also the author of <a href="https://react-styleguidist.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Styleguidist</a>, which was subject of <a href="https://twitter.com/NikkitaFTW" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sara Vieira’s</a> talk the day after (read more below).</p><h4 id="Beyond-JavaScript-The-Real-Benefit-of-React-Native-by-Wojciech-Ogrodowczyk"><a href="#Beyond-JavaScript-The-Real-Benefit-of-React-Native-by-Wojciech-Ogrodowczyk" class="headerlink" title="Beyond JavaScript: The Real Benefit of React Native by Wojciech Ogrodowczyk"></a>Beyond JavaScript: The Real Benefit of React Native by <a href="https://twitter.com/sharnik" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wojciech Ogrodowczyk</a></h4><p>This lightning talk tried to make us developers more critic about what languages we use.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">.<a href="https://twitter.com/sharnik?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@sharnik</a> teaching about language choices, using an example of the Pirahã People in the Amazon <a href="https://t.co/PFd22TQnxF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pic.twitter.com/PFd22TQnxF</a></p>&mdash; Karl Horky (@karlhorky) <a href="https://twitter.com/karlhorky/status/913752918091866113?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">29 September 2017</a></blockquote><p>Instead of saying we are JS developers we should consider ourselves developers and see the good and bad points of the different languages.

We build for what’s needed today and try to make it last, but 2 years in a web project are very long and we quickly find better ways of dealing with past issues.</p><p>Javi explained the theming and customizable constraints imposed by those components, and how he was thinking of isolating the functionality in a <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-toolbox-core" target="_blank" rel="noopener">react-toolbox-core package</a> (<a href="https://github.com/react-toolbox/react-toolbox/tree/agnostic-components" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here the branch</a> and <a href="https://github.com/javivelasco/react-toolbox-airbnb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demo</a>), and make it easy to use any CSS-in-JS (aka JSS) method for styling.</p><h4 id="The-Dream-of-Styleguide-Driven-Development-by-Sara-Vieira-Slides-and-Repo"><a href="#The-Dream-of-Styleguide-Driven-Development-by-Sara-Vieira-Slides-and-Repo" class="headerlink" title="The Dream of Styleguide Driven Development by Sara Vieira - Slides and Repo"></a>The Dream of Styleguide Driven Development by <a href="https://twitter.com/NikkitaFTW" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sara Vieira</a> - <a href="https://styleguide-driven-development-anvohjeduy.now.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slides</a> and <a href="https://github.com/SaraVieira/styleguide-driven-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Repo</a></h4><p>Sara talked about how to split a design into smaller chunks (eg typography, buttons, icons and cards) and isolate them in a style guide that serves to communicate with the designers.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">React <a href="https://twitter.com/styleguidist?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@styleguidist</a> at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/reactalicante?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#reactalicante</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/NikkitaFTW?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@NikkitaFTW</a> 🥘🛥🌅<a href="https://t.co/r7pbggUMag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://t.co/r7pbggUMag</a> <a href="https://t.co/E2F0QlSnh8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pic.twitter.com/E2F0QlSnh8</a></p>&mdash; Artem Sapegin ☕ (@iamsapegin) <a href="https://twitter.com/iamsapegin/status/914057821397897216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">30 September 2017</a></blockquote><p>Creating new pages is a matter of putting those components together, instead of coming up with new ways to codify the style needed for each page.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week I had a blast speaking at <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Alicante-Frontend/events/242461990/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a meetup organised by Alicante Frontend</a>. To me this was really special. Alicante is my home town and it’s also where I studied Computer Science.</p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto,f_auto,c_scale/v1510326708/alicante-frontend_anptgy.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px" alt="Alicante Frontend"></p><a id="more"></a><p>After having been far from the region for some time, I was happy to catch up with some colleagues and confirm that web development is really healthy in Alicante. There are more companies, co-working spaces, meetups and conferences than ever. There is a feeling of collaboration and helping each other that will continue fostering good things.</p><h2 id="Visiting-ULab"><a href="#Visiting-ULab" class="headerlink" title="Visiting ULab"></a>Visiting ULab</h2><p><img src="/assets/images/posts/ulab.jpg" alt="Entrance of ULab — taken from ulab.es"> <small class="caption">Entrance of ULab — taken from <a href="https://ulab.es" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ulab.es</a></small></p><p>The meetup was hosted at <a href="https://ulab.es/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ULab</a>, a coworking space in the centre of Alicante. They offer desks, offices, training rooms and meeting rooms for rent, and have been hosting Alicante Frontend meetups.</p><p>I had the chance to meet with <a href="http://www.soyisabelromero.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Isabel Romer</a>, Product Manager at ULab, who showed me the facilities. We talked about the ecosystem of companies in the area and how Alicante is becoming a hub of tech start-ups.</p><p>The space reminded me of <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/event-space" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CodeNode London</a>, though a bit smaller (1,300 vs 2,100 sqm). I had heard of a few co-working spaces in the region but whenever I checked their website it felt like old offices recycled as mere desks for rent, not taking advantage of an eco-system of companies and professionals collaborating with each other, nor hosting external events.</p><p>I was actually looking for a place like this. I have tried to work remotely sporadically while spending some days in Alicante visiting my family. I’ll definitely try it out when coming back.</p><h2 id="Meeting-the-team-behind-Alicante-Frontend"><a href="#Meeting-the-team-behind-Alicante-Frontend" class="headerlink" title="Meeting the team behind Alicante Frontend"></a>Meeting the team behind Alicante Frontend</h2><p><img src="/assets/images/posts/alicante-frontend-organisers.jpg" alt="Alex Jover, me, Alex Mayol and Álvaro Yuste.

They have been arranging events since December 2016 and are very active on Twitter, GitHub and the aforementioned Slack channels.</p><h2 id="The-talk"><a href="#The-talk" class="headerlink" title="The talk"></a>The talk</h2><p>I talked about web performance optimisation focused on images. The talk was based on the one I gave at JSDayES, but this time I translated it to Spanish.</p><p>Here are <a href="https://slides.com/jmperez/pir-alicante-frontend" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the slides</a>:</p><div class="videoWrapper"><iframe src="//slides.com/jmperez/pir-alicante-frontend/embed" width="576" height="420" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>There were many questions in the Q&amp;A. Some of them were related with the contents of the talk, like how to tackle retina displays, some doubts about lazy loading and whether I had been using Service Workers in my projects at Spotify.</p><p>Lots of other questions were about Spotify and Sweden. How is it working at Spotify, what the culture is like, how we are organised or how we work with designers were a few ones. Also whether it’s very cold and there are lots of depressed people in Sweden. If you wonder, it’s not that cold, at least in Stockholm, and darkness can affect your humour but you’ll probably be fine.</p><p>There were around 60 attendees, and I was told this was the most crowded meetup organised by Alicante Frontend, which made me extra happy.</p><p>I’m sure Alicante Frontend will continue growing and showcasing the local talent.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a post about a hack project I have been working on lately, and I wanted to share some information about why and how I built it.</p><p>tl;dr <a href="https://c-spotify.herokuapp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here is <strong>the demo</strong></a> and <a href="https://github.com/JMPerez/c" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>the project on GitHub</strong></a>.</p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto,f_auto,c_scale/v1510476635/c-collaborative_k8kxsa.png" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px" alt="C, collaborative room to listen to Spotify"></p><a id="more"></a><p><small class="caption">A screenshot of C, a simple collaborative room built using Spotify’s Web API.</small></p><h3 id="Collaborative-listening"><a href="#Collaborative-listening" class="headerlink" title="Collaborative listening"></a>Collaborative listening</h3><p>The idea is basic. You go to a page where you can propose songs to listen to, and other people do the same thing. The playback is synchronised for all users that are connected in that moment.</p><p>These pages are called “rooms”, and are normally based on some genre, to guide users when proposing songs. You don’t want to hear “Despacito” in a the latest rock album in a “80s Classic Hits“ room. The songs that are going to play next, which are in a queue, can also be voted up (sometimes down too). Great if you don’t feel like proposing new songs but you see one you like in the proposed ones.</p><p>As I said, this is not new at all, and in fact it was part of Spotify’s desktop application since <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apvqiFsJcas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">end of 2011</a>, as an app called Soundrop:</p><div class="videoWrapper"><iframe width="720" height="405" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cavizRODpL0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p><small class="caption">Video showing the Soundrop Spotify App.</small></p><p>The app was based on the now defunct <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spotify Apps API</a>. This set of tools allowed custom web apps to run in an isolated view on Spotify’s desktop application, being able to control playback and user’s library.</p><p>Soundrop as a collaborative app is no more. After the removal of the Apps API <a href="http://www.show.co/blog/heavy-hearts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they pivoted to a different product</a>.</p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto,f_auto,c_scale/v1510495292/spotify-app-finder_lfgest.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px" alt="Spotify App Finder"> <small class="caption">List of the initial Spotify Apps. Source: <a href="http://evolver.fm/2011/12/02/spotify-apps-slated-to-roll-out-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evolver.fm</a></small></p><p>The Apps API was the first project I worked on when I joined in Spotify in 2012. I would review submissions, support developers that had questions about how to use it, and create example apps.</p><p>The project <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/11/13/rip-spotify-apps-rip-soundrop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was discontinued end of 2014</a>, and with it these integrations. The Apps API were replaced by mobile SDKs (<a href="https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/spotify-ios-sdk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iOS</a> and <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/spotify-android-sdk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android</a>) and a <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REST API</a>, which we called Web API. The Web API had endpoints for fetching metadata and managing the user’s library through some scopes. If you have ever consumed any other API using OAuth 2.0, this one follows the same approach.</p><p>Though there were many endpoints added through the time, it was still impossible to control the playback through the API. This changed recently with the release of <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/web-api-connect-endpoint-reference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Connect endpoints</a>.</p><h3 id="Spotify-Connect"><a href="#Spotify-Connect" class="headerlink" title="Spotify Connect"></a>Spotify Connect</h3><p>Say you are playing music on your phone. You arrive home and want to start playing on your desktop application. You can transfer the playback from the phone to the desktop, which will pick it up from that moment. The combination phone ↔ desktop works also with speakers, video consoles and the Web Player, which makes this very powerful. These capabilities are called <a href="https://www.spotify.com/connect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Connect</a>.</p><p>The Connect endpoints allow you to list the devices available for the user and transfer the playback between them. The set of endpoints is still in beta and subject to change, but it’s handy to work on a few hacks.</p><h4 id="Now-Playing"><a href="#Now-Playing" class="headerlink" title="Now Playing"></a>Now Playing</h4><p>A few weeks ago <a href="/spotify-connect-api">I published a post talking about a small library I built to fetch what you are playing on Spotify</a>. The library is handy for not having to deal with the authorisation flow, and makes it easy to crease visualisations such as <a href="https://codepen.io/jmperez/full/MmwObE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this one</a>:</p><iframe id="cp_embed_MmwObE" src="//codepen.io/jmperez/embed/MmwObE?height=389&theme-id=0&slug-hash=MmwObE&default-tab=result" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" height="389" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" class="cp_embed_iframe" data-amp-width="100%" style="width: 100%; overflow: hidden"></iframe><p>I created some other visualisations and organised them on <a href="https://codepen.io/collection/AyVBYB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this Codepen collection</a>.</p><h3 id="Implementing-basic-collaborative-listening-with-Connect"><a href="#Implementing-basic-collaborative-listening-with-Connect" class="headerlink" title="Implementing basic collaborative listening with Connect"></a>Implementing basic collaborative listening with Connect</h3><p>Now that we’ve gone through an overview of what we want to accomplish and what tools we have available, let’s go for it.</p><p>When you log in with your Spotify account you will enter a room where y<strong>ou can add songs and let the website control your playback</strong> (you should have a Spotify application opened, like the mobile app, desktop app or <a href="https://open.spotify.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">web player</a>)</p><p>If you think about it, <strong>a room for adding songs is basically a chat room</strong>. Instead of sending regular text messages you send commands like “add song” or “remove song” and the server makes sure all connected users get the updates and are kept in sync.</p><p>One use case is using the demo only as a controller, and not a speaker. Imagine that we have a speaker at work. We might want to queue songs but not having them playing from our computer. That’s what the mute/unmute button does. It will mute or stop syncing your playback with the room’s playback.</p><p>Another feature, or lack of it, is that the controller is the web site and not the server. <strong>Your playback will be synced with the room as long as you have the website open</strong>. This could be changed by letting the server make these requests on your behalf. After all, it has access to your refresh token when logging in. However, it’s easy to forget that you didn’t log out from the demo and freak out when something is changing your playback randomly, so that’s why I didn’t take this approach.</p><p>A limitation is that the project only works with Spotify Premium accounts, <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/working-with-connect/#Premium%20Only" target="_blank" rel="noopener">due to this restriction on the Connect endpoints</a>. You can still add songs, but the “play” command won’t work if your account is a free one.</p><p><strong>The Robot</strong></p><p>You are not alone in the room. <strong>A bot called “Robot” is always online</strong>, taking care of adding songs to the queue when it gets empty, based on previous submitted songs by users.</p><p>The data is provided by the Web API through its <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-recommendations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Get Recommendations Based on Seeds</a> endpoint. This endpoint returns a list of tracks that are based on a list of artists, genres and tracks, and you can set constraints on many music attributes.</p><p>Thus, you could want the Robot to put more energetic music on Fridays. Or have a robot adding recommendations based on Rock music in a Rock room. For this one, check out <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-recommendations/#available-genre-seeds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the list of available genre seeds</a>. At the moment there are 126 genres of them. Not bad!</p><p><strong>Future?</strong></p><p>The demo is basic. The design is unpolished and the site is limited to a single room. However, it’s easy to deploy on a custom instance and the main goal is to serve to others that want to integrate with Spotify’s APIs. It’s open source, so you can fork it and do as you wish.</p><p>The project would be easy to tweak to cover other use cases. One of them would be <strong>synchronised sessions</strong>. Say I listen to great music (no, I don’t) and someone wants to tune in and listen exactly to what I’m listening to. You <em>just</em> need to assume every publishing user is a room, listen to changes in user’s playback and publish them, synchronising the subscribed users.</p><h3 id="Nerdy-details"><a href="#Nerdy-details" class="headerlink" title="Nerdy details"></a>Nerdy details</h3><p>The project uses React + Redux for rendering, and Node in the backend,this is all done using <a href="https://github.com/zeit/next.js/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Next.js</a>, which also make Server-Side Rendering easy. An additional tweak is that React is replaced with Preact in production for a smaller payload. The whole thing is deployed on a Heroku instance.</p><p>One of the reasons I wanted to hack on Next.js was to have a better picture of its overhead. For this hack, the main page loads a bundle for the index page that is ~2.8kB minified &amp; gzipped, and the common bundle which is 80.6kB minified &amp; gzipped. It’s not the lightest alternative, but <strong>Next.js is designed to scale well as you add more pages to your site</strong>, due to how the bundles are split per page out of the box. Adding a large component to one page will not have an impact in the JS loaded for another page.</p><p>I have played with several ideas in the code base, that’s why it’s not very uniform and you’ll see, for example, several ways of doing CSS-in-JS.</p><p>I use this kind of hacks to give some new libraries and techniques a try, making them part of my tool belt and maybe using them in some real project. It’s also good to give Spotify’s Web API folks some feedback about the endpoints.</p><p>Regarding Next.js this project was pretty much an excuse to try out this library/framework. Yes, I could have picked any other project but my ideas always gravitate around Spotify-stuff. I wanted to see how opinionated it was, how SSR worked in that page-component pattern they use, and how it feels working with it.</p><h4 id="Why-Next-js"><a href="#Why-Next-js" class="headerlink" title="Why Next.js"></a>Why Next.js</h4><p>If you’ve ever tried to set up your own React.JS + ES6 + Webpack + react-intl + whatnot and have succeed without sweating, I’m your fan. Whenever I try, I always end up using some boilerplate project with everything in place.</p><p>I like <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create-react-app</a>. It makes everything so easier, and you can always go leave the wizard mode by eject-ing. No lock-in.</p><p>I have been following Next.js from the distance. I would read about it, but never had the time nor the energy to give it a try. I decided it was about time I put it in practice.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/posts/learn-nextjs.png" alt="Learn Next.js"></p><p><small class="caption"><a href="https://learnnextjs.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learnnext.js</a> is a great interactive step-by-step tutorial. If I ever write a library I’ll make sure the tutorial is as great as the library itself, so it’s easy to learn and adopt.</small></p><p>I started reading a bit and followed <a href="https://learnnextjs.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LearnNext.js</a>. I found it too basic at first, then I jumped to the code, but quickly had to go back to the tutorial. It’s good not to take shortcuts. Their tutorial might seem easy but there are some concepts that are important, or you face problems soon.</p><p>The best resource I found for Next.js is <a href="https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/master/examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the examples folder in their repo</a>. It’s pure gold. Lots of concise examples of how to use Next.js with pretty much anything. Pick ’n’ mix. I wanted to combine express + preact + redux + socket.io, and I had examples there for all of this.</p><p>I would say the most difficult part is when you realise that part of your code is running on the server. It’s quite surprising, but it’s what SSR is about. <code>localStorage</code> and <code>fetch</code> would fail, and other browser-only properties we are used to access when working with JS.</p><p>Overall I’m really happy. Most of your code is the same and you only need to adapt a bit to their routing. That’s what I like the most. It gives you the glue to put everything together, but you can still use the tools you are used to.</p><p>Zeit’s project are really awesome. Simple but extremely useful.</p><p>If you haven’t done it yet, have a look at <a href="https://c-spotify.herokuapp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>the demo</strong></a> and <a href="https://github.com/JMPerez/c" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>the project on GitHub</strong></a>.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week I came across <a href="https://hackernoon.com/removing-that-ugly-focus-ring-and-keeping-it-too-6c8727fefcd2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Removing that ugly :focus ring (and keeping it too)</a>. It’s a really good post about <code>outline</code>, that CSS property lots of devs tend to hide. The post explains some a11y-friendly alternatives to not display it, and show it when needed.</p><a id="more"></a><p>In the past I have made the same mistake of hiding the <code>outline</code> altogether, but no more!</p><p>A few months ago I came across a similar technique David Gilbertson describes, while inspecting the markup on Youtube.com. They take accessibility seriously and their player is a very good example to get inspiration from.</p><p>I then applied it to one of the Spotify sites I work on. Take <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2ZBNclC5wm4GtiWaeh0DMx?fo=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this Spotify page as an example</a>. This is how it works:</p><ol><li>Add a <code>no-focus-outline</code> CSS class to the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element.</li><li>Hide the outline using CSS only in <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> elements that descend from that class.</li><li>When tabbing, remove the CSS class.</li></ol><p>The complete code:</p><p><strong>CSS</strong><figure class="highlight css"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><div class="line"><span class="selector-class">.no-focus-outline</span> <span class="selector-tag">a</span><span class="selector-pseudo">:focus</span>,</div><div class="line"><span class="selector-class">.no-focus-outline</span> <span class="selector-tag">button</span><span class="selector-pseudo">:focus</span> &#123;</div><div class="line">  <span class="attribute">outline</span>: none;</div><div class="line">&#125;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p><strong>JS</strong><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><div class="line"><span class="comment">// Listen to tab events to enable outlines (accessibility improvement)</span></div><div class="line"><span class="built_in">document</span>.body.addEventListener(<span class="string">'keyup'</span>, <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params">e</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class="line">  <span class="keyword">if</span> (e.which === <span class="number">9</span>) <span class="comment">/* tab */</span> &#123;</div><div class="line">    <span class="built_in">document</span>.documentElement.classList.remove(<span class="string">'no-focus-outline'</span>);</div><div class="line">  &#125;</div><div class="line">&#125;);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>And a video showing what it looks like when tabbing:</p><div style="text-align:center"><video width="320" height="560" controls src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/video/upload/v1510495843/css-outline-focus_olx6zh.mp4"></video></div><p>Some additional a11y improvements are that I apply the same effect on hover and on focus, like when going through the “More by …” albums section. Last, but not least, the track row acts as a button to start the playback.</p><p>These are some small touches that very few people will realise, but are not difficult to implement and can have a very positive impact for some users.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The web ecosystem is maturing and every day we understand better how to architecture large and maintainable web applications. We also understand what makes our sites slower and are coming up with solutions to overcome this.</p><p>Building a complex site that can work on slow networks is a challenge. One that some companies have decided to accept without fear and share with the developer community.</p><a id="more"></a><h2 id="Western-companies-looking-at-users-from-developing-countries"><a href="#Western-companies-looking-at-users-from-developing-countries" class="headerlink" title="Western companies looking at users from developing countries"></a>Western companies looking at users from developing countries</h2><p>Instagram, Twitter, Uber, Tinder. They have in common that they are well known in the developed world, and also that they have embraced the web as the channel to reach users in emerging markets. Not as a basic site with a large modal to download the app, but with a full-feature experience. After all, web users shouldn’t be considered second-class citizens.</p><p>Twitter has been great at talking about implementation details (see <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2017/introducing-twitter-lite.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Introducing Twitter Lite</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@paularmstrong/twitter-lite-and-high-performance-react-progressive-web-apps-at-scale-d28a00e780a3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter Lite and High Performance React Progressive Web Apps at Scale</a>) which is really helpful for devs like me who face some of these challenges on a daily basis. And, because anyone can see the code you ship, it’s easy to look <a href="Twitter Lite and High Performance React Progressive Web Apps at Scale">into the details</a>.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/posts/twitter-lite.png" alt="Twitter Lite&#39;s saving options"></p><p><small class="caption">Twitter Lite also offers an option to save data.</small></p><p>The case of Instagram is notable too because of its scale. They recently <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/05/09/instagram-mobile-website-upload-photos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added photo upload</a> to their mobile site in a clear sign of their investment on the platform, but haven’t shared details about how the tech behind the site. Tinder is a similar case, with <a href="http://blog.gotinder.com/introducing-tinder-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a newer website</a>.</p><p>And a couple of days ago it was Uber with <a href="https://eng.uber.com/m-uber/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Building m.uber: Engineering a high-performance web app for the global market</a>.

Updating web content is almost instantaneous. This means deploying new features, but also fixing bugs. And believe me, when there is a big issue and you need to fix something right now, time is precious.</p><p>Developers can ship code without an expensive process of building whole apps and have them go through a submission/revision system. They also benefit from quicker feedback loops when coding and seeing their changes on the screen (to be fair, React Native is making this one way better in the native world).</p><h2 id="The-mobile-web-in-2017"><a href="#The-mobile-web-in-2017" class="headerlink" title="The mobile web in 2017"></a>The mobile web in 2017</h2><p>When I saw <a href="https://twitter.com/markdalgleish/status/879144162389393409" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this tweet</a> I laughed out loud.</p><p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Updated: The mobile web in 2017, <strong>now with web fonts!</strong><br><br>(Original: <a href="https://t.co/nLta2tqk42" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://t.co/nLta2tqk42</a>) <a href="https://t.co/c4ZgEdkbU8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pic.twitter.com/c4ZgEdkbU8</a></p>&mdash; Mark Dalgleish (@markdalgleish) <a href="https://twitter.com/markdalgleish/status/879144162389393409" target="_blank" rel="noopener">26 June 2017</a></blockquote></p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>A moment later I got sad since this is quite true.

Will even network speed be a problem in the future?</p><p>It’s very interesting to see these trends going back and forth. At a minimum, we should always build for our users and avoid assumptions. Not all of them use powerful MacBook Pros nor have the latest iPhone.</p><p>We are paid to face these challenges, to serve our users.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2017/06/chrome-60-beta-paint-timing-api-css.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent post about Chrome 60 Beta</a>, Google announced the support of the Paint Timing API to get metrics on when your page starts rendering and when the user gets content that can be consumed (more info on the definition of the events below). Here I’m going to describe this new API a bit and show you how to use it.</p><a id="more"></a><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto,f_auto,c_scale/v1510494808/paint-timing-example_byc6z2.png" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px" alt="Example of Paint Timing API entries"> <small class="caption">Image taken from the <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2017/06/chrome-60-beta-paint-timing-api-css.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chrome 60 blog post</a>, which first appeared in <a href="https://youtu.be/6Ljq-Jn-EgU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Web Performance: Leveraging the Metrics that Most Affect User Experience”</a> at Google I/O 2017</small></p><p>Up until now we have been measuring performance through other metrics, mostly using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Navigation_timing_API" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Navigation Timing API</a>, which is also what Google Analytics uses for their <a href="http://www.ericmobley.net/measuring-performance-google-analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Site Speed report</a>. Yet those metrics don’t tell us the whole picture about the rendering experience.</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/WICG/paint-timing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paint Timing API</a> aims to improve this by exposing metrics on paint events that are grouped in two types of entries. By <a href="https://github.com/WICG/paint-timing#definition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its definition</a>:</p><ul><li><code>&quot;first-paint&quot;</code> entries contain a <code>DOMHighResTimeStamp</code> reporting the time when the browser first rendered after navigation. This excludes the default background paint, but includes non-default background paint. This is the first key moment developers care about in page load – when the browser has started to render the page.</li><li><code>&quot;first-contentful-paint&quot;</code> contain a <code>DOMHighResTimestamp</code> reporting the time when the browser first rendered any text, image (including background images), non-white canvas or SVG. This includes text with pending webfonts. This is the first time users could start consuming page content.</li></ul><p>A picture is worth a thousand words, so let’s see how these entries would be reported by some real web sites:</p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto,f_auto,c_scale/v1510476598/paint-timing-filmstrip_anq3pv.png" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px" alt="Filmstrip from several sites showing when Paint Timing API entries are triggered"> <small class="caption">Image taken from the <a href="https://github.com/WICG/paint-timing#examples" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paint timing API repo on WICG</a>.</small></p><h4 id="Hacking-on-it"><a href="#Hacking-on-it" class="headerlink" title="Hacking on it"></a>Hacking on it</h4><p>As a hack project I decided to give it a try and implement it on a web site. You have a basic example <a href="https://github.com/WICG/paint-timing#usage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the Paint timing page</a>:</p><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><div class="line"><span class="keyword">var</span> observer = <span class="keyword">new</span> PerformanceObserver(<span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params">list</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class="line">  <span class="keyword">var</span> perfEntries = list.getEntries();</div><div class="line">  <span class="keyword">for</span> (<span class="keyword">var</span> i = <span class="number">0</span>; i &lt; perfEntries.length; i++) &#123;</div><div class="line">     <span class="comment">// Process entries</span></div><div class="line">     <span class="comment">// report back for analytics and monitoring</span></div><div class="line">     <span class="comment">// ...</span></div><div class="line">  &#125;</div><div class="line">&#125;);</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line"><span class="comment">// register observer for long task notifications</span></div><div class="line">observer.observe(&#123;<span class="attr">entryTypes</span>: [<span class="string">"paint"</span>]&#125;);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>In practice you will probably want to report the information somewhere you can track it. If you are using Google Analytics, you can use <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/06/user-centric-performance-metrics#tracking_fpfcp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this snippet from Google’s Developer site</a> (ES6):</p><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><div class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> observer = <span class="keyword">new</span> PerformanceObserver(<span class="function">(<span class="params">list</span>) =&gt;</span> &#123;</div><div class="line">  <span class="keyword">for</span> (<span class="keyword">const</span> entry <span class="keyword">of</span> list.getEntries()) &#123;</div><div class="line">    <span class="comment">// `name` will be either 'first-paint' or 'first-contentful-paint'.</span></div><div class="line">    <span class="keyword">const</span> metricName = entry.name;</div><div class="line">    <span class="keyword">const</span> time = <span class="built_in">Math</span>.round(entry.startTime + entry.duration);</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">    ga(<span class="string">'send'</span>, <span class="string">'event'</span>, &#123;</div><div class="line">      <span class="attr">eventCategory</span>: <span class="string">'Performance Metrics'</span>,</div><div class="line">      <span class="attr">eventAction</span>: metricName,</div><div class="line">      <span class="attr">eventValue</span>: time,</div><div class="line">      <span class="attr">nonInteraction</span>: <span class="literal">true</span>,</div><div class="line">    &#125;);</div><div class="line">  &#125;</div><div class="line">&#125;);</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line"><span class="comment">// Start observing paint entries.</span></div><div class="line">observer.observe(&#123;<span class="attr">entryTypes</span>: [<span class="string">'paint'</span>]&#125;);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h4 id="Word-of-Caution"><a href="#Word-of-Caution" class="headerlink" title="Word of Caution"></a>Word of Caution</h4><p>The API is still experimental and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceObserver" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in “Editor’s Draft” state</a>. Also, the fact that a browser supports PerformanceObserver doesn’t mean that it supports the Paint events.</p><p>In the quick test I run, the above snippet would throw an exception:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">Uncaught TypeError: Failed to execute ‘observe’ on</div><div class="line">‘PerformanceObserver’: A Performance Observer MUST</div><div class="line">have at least one valid entryType in its entryTypes</div><div class="line">attribute.</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>It turns out that if you only observe the <code>paint</code> entryType and this is not supported in the browser, <strong>it will throw an exception</strong>. According to <a href="https://w3c.github.io/performance-timeline/#dom-performanceobserverinit-entrytypes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the specification</a>:</p><blockquote><p><code>entryTypes</code>: A list of entry names to be observed. The list must not be empty and types not recognized by the user agent must be ignored.</p></blockquote><p>In short, if you are giving this API a try, make sure you <code>try...catch</code> the <code>observer.observe()</code> call.</p><h4 id="Conclusions"><a href="#Conclusions" class="headerlink" title="Conclusions"></a>Conclusions</h4><p>This is a bit in early stages but I’m looking forward to see how the API evolves and we can use it to track Web Performance even better. This will also be a great addition to <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LightHouse</a>, <a href="http://www.webpagetest.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WebPageTest</a>, <a href="https://calibreapp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Calibre</a> and the rest of tools we use to monitor metrics on our sites.</p>]]></content>

There is a lot going on in Madrid and the rest of Spain, with very interesting companies building awesome products.</p><a id="more"></a><p>There were 500+ attendees and the event had 3 tracks with 26 talks, shorter and longer ones, and workshops. It was difficult to attend the talks and workshops I wanted to, not only because of time constraints but also space. I’m looking forward to watching some of the talks on video when they upload the recordings, and update this post with the ones I find most interesting.</p><p>The event showcased the local talent, with a track dedicated to “rising stars” for speakers with less experience, which I think was a great idea. There was an international one with English-speaking talks, and finally the main track with some talks in English, some others in Spanish.</p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto,f_auto,c_scale/v1510476603/jsdayes-2017-pinchito-substack_gvvsvg.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px" alt="Pinchito and Substack"> <small class="caption">Alex (<a href="https://twitter.com/pinchito" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@pinchito</a>) introducing James Halliday’s (<a href="https://twitter.com/substack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@substack</a>) talk.</small></p><p>This is the third edition of the event, which is consolidating as the main Javascript conference in Spain.</p><p>Being a Spaniard myself it was fine, but I would like to see even more talks in English, making the event more internationally renowned. This would not only help the event, but also the speakers which could have a higher impact by making their talks more accessible to the rest of the world.</p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto,f_auto,c_scale/v1510496367/jsdayes-2017-sign_lojgs2.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px" alt="The JSDayES 2017 sign by the entrance of the venue"></p><h2 id="My-talk-about-“Progressive-Image-Rendering”"><a href="#My-talk-about-“Progressive-Image-Rendering”" class="headerlink" title="My talk about “Progressive Image Rendering”"></a>My talk about “Progressive Image Rendering”</h2><div class="videoWrapper"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/220960739?byline=0&portrait=0" width="684" height="385" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>This talk is similar to the one I gave at <a href="/cssconf-au-2016">CSSConf AU</a> and <a href="/render-conf-oxford-2017">RenderConf Oxford</a>.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Spotify <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/news-stories/2017/04/10/new-endpoints-beta-web-api-connect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released recently a set of endpoints</a> in beta to fetch information of what is playing and send playback commands. This allows for a wide range of integrations and I wanted to hack a bit with it.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/posts/spotify-connect.jpg" alt="Spotify Connect"></p><a id="more"></a><h4 id="What-is-Spotify-Connect"><a href="#What-is-Spotify-Connect" class="headerlink" title="What is Spotify Connect"></a>What is Spotify Connect</h4><p><a href="https://www.spotify.com/connect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spotify Connect</a> is a way to transmit the playback from one device to another one without having to use a physical connection like a cable or bluetooth. You can send the music from your Spotify desktop client to a speaker, from the Spotify app on mobile to Spotify for PlayStation, from the Spotify web player to Chromecast… In short, you have controllers and devices that can play music.</p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto,f_auto,c_scale/v1510477863/spotify-web-player_k5sx2j.png" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px" alt="Spotify Web Player"> <small class="caption">Spotify’s Web Player (zoomed in). Clicking on the icon next to the volume we get a list of connected devices (FireTV, desktop client, speakers and the web player).</small></p><p>Your application can become a controller through the Web API endpoints, getting information about what is playing currently and from where, being able to transmit the playback to another connected device or interact with the current context (pausing, changing the volume, skipping, playing something else…).</p><h4 id="How-to-use-the-endpoints"><a href="#How-to-use-the-endpoints" class="headerlink" title="How to use the endpoints"></a>How to use the endpoints</h4><p>Before using the Connect endpoints we need to obtain an access token on behalf of the user with certain permissions. There is more information about what scopes are needed in the documentation for each endpoint.</p><p>You don’t need to have a premium account to get the playback status, a free account is alright. You will do need a premium one if you want to <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/working-with-connect/#premium-only" target="_blank" rel="noopener">send commands to change the playback</a>.</p><p>A caveat at the moment is that the endpoints don’t support any kind of web socket connection nor long polling. Thus, if you want to get updates on the position of the current playing track or any other change in the context, you need to poll every few seconds.</p><h4 id="A-small-library-to-make-it-easier-to-use-the-endpoints"><a href="#A-small-library-to-make-it-easier-to-use-the-endpoints" class="headerlink" title="A small library to make it easier to use the endpoints"></a>A small library to make it easier to use the endpoints</h4><p>The trickiest part of using the Spotify Web API is to implement the authorization flow. <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/authorization-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Authorization Guide</a> does a good job explaining it, but I thought I could do something so developers wouldn’t need to worry about setting up the whole flow, hiding away the authentication and just getting.</p><p>That’s why I have created <a href="https://github.com/JMPerez/spotify-player" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotify-player</a>. It’s both a server and a library that you use to communicate with it. To use it, you just need to include a script, call login() and subscribe to the updates:</p><figure class="highlight html"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><div class="line"><span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">script</span> <span class="attr">src</span>=<span class="string">"https://spotify-player.herokuapp.com/spotify-player.js"</span>&gt;</span><span class="undefined"></span><span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">script</span>&gt;</span></div></pre></td></tr></table></figure><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><div class="line"><span class="keyword">var</span> spotifyPlayer = <span class="keyword">new</span> SpotifyPlayer();</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">spotifyPlayer.on(<span class="string">'update'</span>, response =&gt; &#123;</div><div class="line">  <span class="comment">// render the track received</span></div><div class="line">&#125;);</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">spotifyPlayer.on(<span class="string">'login'</span>, user =&gt; &#123;</div><div class="line">  <span class="keyword">if</span> (user === <span class="literal">null</span>) &#123;</div><div class="line">    <span class="comment">// no user</span></div><div class="line">  &#125; <span class="keyword">else</span> &#123;</div><div class="line">    <span class="comment">// say hello to the user, and tell them to play something!</span></div><div class="line">  &#125;</div><div class="line">&#125;);</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">spotifyPlayer.init();</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">spotifyPlayer.login();</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>You can forget about <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications" target="_blank" rel="noopener">setting up a Spotify application</a> and a server, carrying out the token exchange, token refresh, and persisting the current user, <strong>so you can focus on the fun part</strong>.</p><p>Other methods include a function to make calls to other Spotify endpoints reusing the same access token, so you can fetch other data that can help you creating a more complete visualisation.</p><p>Let’s have a look at <a href="https://codepen.io/jmperez/full/MmwObE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this pen</a> as an example of a basic visualisation:</p><iframe id="cp_embed_MmwObE" src="//codepen.io/jmperez/embed/MmwObE?height=389&theme-id=0&slug-hash=MmwObE&default-tab=result" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" height="389" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" class="cp_embed_iframe" data-amp-width="100%" style="width: 100%; overflow: hidden"></iframe><p>And in case you can’t try it or don’t have a Spotify account this is pretty much what it looks like:</p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto,f_auto,c_scale/v1510476629/spotify-connect-api-visualisation-example_hwu7uw.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px" alt="Example of a visualisation of Spotify"> <small class="caption">See <a href="https://codepen.io/jmperez/full/MmwObE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Pen on Codepen</a></small></p><p>I have kept the example very basic since the point is understanding the usage of the library. If you are into performance and UX you’ll see there is room for improvement, but as a front-end developer I know an example can get out of hand very easily when adding things.</p><p>I encourage you to fork it and start making your own visualisation. And once you do it, ping me so I include it in <a href="https://codepen.io/collection/AyVBYB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this Codepen collection</a>.</p><h3 id="Possible-applications"><a href="#Possible-applications" class="headerlink" title="Possible applications"></a>Possible applications</h3><p><em>Disclaimer: This is a list of some use cases.

Or a small browser extension showing what is playing and/or <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/notifications" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showing desktop notifications</a> when the track changes.</p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto,f_auto,c_scale/v1510477615/spotify-connect-api-visualisation-notification_mgxad5.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px" alt="Spotify Visualisation showing Web Notifications when the track changes"> <small class="caption">See <a href="https://codepen.io/jmperez/full/VbvPbR" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Pen on Codepen</a>. When the track changes the browser shows a Web Notification.</small></p><p>Or if you are at home hosting a dinner or party, show on the TV or computer what is playing.</p><p>You can combine other Spotify Web API endpoints too. Eg you could <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-artist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fetch the artists info</a> to show the artist profile image in the background:</p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto,f_auto,c_scale/v1510477674/spotify-connect-api-visualisation-artist_ebk7cc.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px" alt="Spotify Visualisation showing the artist profile image in the background"> <small class="caption">See <a href="https://codepen.io/jmperez/full/YVXEaz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Pen on Codepen</a>.

The venue was next to the Thames river, with a very spacious room for the talks, another large room for sponsors and meals, and a third room for speakers.</p><p>I have only talked in two other occasions and this is the first time I get to enjoy a speakers room. It really helps calming the nerves, focusing, and making those last minute fixes to the slides.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="/medium-image-progressive-loading-placeholder">a past post</a> I dissected a technique used by Medium to display images, transitioning from a blurry image to the final one. Since then I have found some more sites following a similar approach. Let’s see how Quora, Quartz and Clicktorelease do it.</p><a id="more"></a><h2 id="Quick-Introduction"><a href="#Quick-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Quick Introduction"></a>Quick Introduction</h2><p>Images are the largest assets on web pages and they account for two thirds of the bytes. Image optimisation and choosing the right image format is paramount. In addition, some sites are also using small thumbnails as placeholders while the final image hasn’t loaded yet. This technique is also called <em>“<a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-blur-up-technique-for-loading-background-images/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blur-up</a>“</em>. It basically tries to improve user’s perceived performance while also saving data traffic when combined with lazy-loading.</p><p>There are other alternatives to this approach. One of them consists of using a single JPEG image, tweaking its scan script to quickly render an initial pixelated version of the image and progressively load the final image in several scans. I recommend you having a look at <a href="http://cloudinary.com/blog/progressive_jpegs_and_green_martians" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Progressive JPEGs and green Martians</a> to know more about this.</p><p>Also, if you like images optimisation, follow <a href="http://cloudinary.com/blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cloudinary’s Blog</a>, full with useful posts on this topic.</p><h3 id="Quartz"><a href="#Quartz" class="headerlink" title="Quartz"></a>Quartz</h3><p>Take a look at the following video, recorded when accessing <a href="https://qz.com/894001/theres-a-wrong-and-a-right-way-to-talk-to-your-dog-according-to-science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a page on QZ.com</a> with a throttled connection:</p><figure class="videoWrapper"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cbz3V4FGCE4" allowfullscreen width="720" height="393" frameborder="0"></iframe></figure><p>Quartz’s implementation follows this steps:</p><ol><li>Request a small <code>&lt;img/&gt;</code> that will be blurred. In their case, they use 50px width images, with a 80% quality.</li><li>Apply blur effect using a CSS filter.</li><li>Request the large image.</li></ol><p>One of the interesting points about Quartz is that their markup specifies the large image using the syntax for responsive images. The main difference is that they use a <code>data-srcset</code> attribute, so they control when to make the request and prevent the browser from requesting the large version of the image when the markup is parsed.</p><p>I find this approach very neat since they try to follow the “standard” way to serve images, adding extra bits to lazy load and animate the transition.</p><figure class="highlight html"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><div class="line"><span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">figure</span> <span class="attr">class</span>=<span class="string">"progressive-image featured-image size-extra-large"</span>&gt;</span></div><div class="line">  <span class="comment">&lt;!-- a picture element with intrinsic ratio --&gt;</span></div><div class="line">  <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">picture</span> <span class="attr">style</span>=<span class="string">"padding-bottom: 56.1875%; background-image: url(https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/fish.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=50);"</span>&gt;</span></div><div class="line">    <span class="comment">&lt;!-- the small image that will be blurred --&gt;</span></div><div class="line">    <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">img</span> <span class="attr">src</span>=<span class="string">"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/fish.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=50"</span> <span class="attr">class</span>=<span class="string">"progressive-image-thumbnail"</span>&gt;</span></div><div class="line">    <span class="comment">&lt;!-- a lazy responsive image with data-srcset --&gt;</span></div><div class="line">    <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">img</span></span></div><div class="line">      <span class="attr">itemprop</span>=<span class="string">"image"</span></div><div class="line">      <span class="attr">data-srcset</span>=<span class="string">"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/fish.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=320 320w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/fish.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640 640w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/fish.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=940 940w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/fish.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/fish.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=3200 3200w"</span></div><div class="line">      <span class="attr">data-src</span>=<span class="string">"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/fish.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=320"</span></div><div class="line">      <span class="attr">class</span>=<span class="string">"progressive-image-large"</span> <span class="attr">alt</span>=<span class="string">"INDIA-fishermen"</span>/&gt;</div><div class="line">    <span class="comment">&lt;!-- a noscript fallback --&gt;</span></div><div class="line">    <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">noscript</span>&gt;</span></div><div class="line">      <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">img</span></span></div><div class="line">        <span class="attr">src</span>=<span class="string">"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/fish.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=320"</span></div><div class="line">        <span class="attr">alt</span>=<span class="string">"INDIA-fishermen"</span>&gt;</div><div class="line">    <span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">noscript</span>&gt;</span></div><div class="line">  <span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">picture</span>&gt;</span></div><div class="line">  <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">figcaption</span>&gt;</span>...<span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">figcaption</span>&gt;</span></div><div class="line"><span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">figure</span>&gt;</span></div></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h3 id="Quora"><a href="#Quora" class="headerlink" title="Quora"></a>Quora</h3><p>Quora also implements a blur-up technique for the images in their posts.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I usually see myself spending more time migrating from one setup to another one than writing valuable content. After all, I consider my blog a playground where I try some concepts.</p><p>It is still <a href="http://jlongster.com/Presenting-The-Most-Over-Engineered-Blog-Ever" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not very over-engineered</a> and <a href="https://github.com/JMPerez/jmperez.github.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">being open sourced and available on GitHub</a> I thought someone could benefit from it.</p><a id="more"></a><h2 id="Static-Site"><a href="#Static-Site" class="headerlink" title="Static Site"></a>Static Site</h2><p>The blog is a set of static pages. Before that it used to be a Wordpress site and eventually <a href="/migrating-wordpress-jekyll-github-pages">I migrated to Jekyll and GitHub Pages</a>. This worked really well because I could take advantage of GitHub’s distributed storage to serve the assets, and there is nothing that can beat a static site in terms of performance, which I care about.</p><p>In October 2016 I migrated to <a href="https://hexo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hexo</a>. Hexo is fast, and the posts are written in the same Markdown format I like and I used with Jekyll, so moving to Hexo was really easy.</p><p>Migrating to Hexo was a bit of a trade-off. Now I need to generate the static site from my computer and then deploy the files, instead of just using the GitHub editor, which was handy to fix small typos. The advantage is that I can create plugins in Javascript (and understand and tweak existing ones) to customise the output, which is better overall.</p><h2 id="Progressive-Images"><a href="#Progressive-Images" class="headerlink" title="Progressive Images"></a>Progressive Images</h2><p>The few JPG images on this site are progressive JPGs, <a href="/ssim-jpeg-io">generated using Jpeg.io</a>. Having a more custom technique to load images, like <a href="/medium-image-progressive-loading-placeholder">Medium’s approach</a>, is overkill. Progressive JPGs start rendering soon, and as the browser downloads more of the file it shows a better version of the image. You can see an example on <a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/result/170207_N3_1794c7ee69d5a1a3eb92842504f01a7b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this WebPageTest run</a>.</p><p><a href="/assets/images/posts/jmperez-filmstrip.png"><img src="/assets/images/posts/jmperez-filmstrip.png" alt="Filmstrip for jmperezperez.com"></a></p><p>Something in my to-do list is to prevent <a href="https://css-tricks.com/content-jumping-avoid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">content jumping</a> by using some <a href="http://blog.learningspaces.io/flexible-cover-images-using-intrinsic-ratio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">intrinsic ratio placeholders</a> for the images, and lazy-load them.</p><h2 id="SSL-and-HTTP-2"><a href="#SSL-and-HTTP-2" class="headerlink" title="SSL and HTTP/2"></a>SSL and HTTP/2</h2><p>This site is served on HTTPS. I already talked about <a href="/github-pages-ssl-custom-domain">how and why I migrated to SSL</a>. A good thing about using Cloudflare for SSL is that I also get HTTP/2 support, so I can start investigating it a bit more. I would like to give Server Push a try though, but for that I would need to run my own server. Maybe some time in the future.</p><p>Finally, Cloudflare also allows me to set the browser cache expiration, increasing the short one that GitHub Pages set by default.</p><h2 id="Accelerated-Mobile-Pages-aka-AMP"><a href="#Accelerated-Mobile-Pages-aka-AMP" class="headerlink" title="Accelerated Mobile Pages (aka AMP)"></a>Accelerated Mobile Pages (aka AMP)</h2><p>I’m not a big fan of <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google’s AMP</a>, <a href="https://instantarticles.fb.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook’s Instant Articles</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news-publisher/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple News</a>. I think developers can create experiences on the web with a good performance without having to resort to a subset of the language nor a specific markup for a proprietary crawler.</p><p>Still, I wanted to give AMP a try, so I now generate an AMP version of every post on build time. Does it have any impact in traffic? Well, not much yet. Only around 2% of the page views to this site are for AMP’d pages.</p><h2 id="Service-Worker-and-Offline-content"><a href="#Service-Worker-and-Offline-content" class="headerlink" title="Service Worker and Offline content"></a>Service Worker and Offline content</h2><p>The last addition to the site is a Service Worker which caches the main sections of this blog (home, projects, about) plus an offline page linking to those three. Additionally, if you visit a page it will be available when offline. I think it is a good trade-off.</p><p><a href="/sw.js">The implementation</a> is based on <a href="https://serviceworke.rs/strategy-cache-and-update_service-worker_doc.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the cache and update strategy</a> with a small variation. In my case I check the network, then the cache, and finally serve the <code>offline</code> page if no hit.</p><p>If you are thinking of making your site available when offline, be a good citizen. I have seen Service Workers that download all the posts from a blog. To be honest, this doesn’t do any good for your users. By doing so you might be killing their data plan or using precious space in their devices. If you still want to preload/prefetch/download content, do it wisely.</p><p>When browsing the App Store/Play Store, the user has an indication of the size of the app, so they might choose not to download it when they are using roaming or tethering. On the web we don’t have something like this.</p><h2 id="Performance"><a href="#Performance" class="headerlink" title="Performance"></a>Performance</h2><p>I like talking about web performance so my own site has to be a good example of what I advocate for. I use <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjmperezperez.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PageSpeed Insights</a> to check the performance and usability on mobile (score &gt;=99/100 for most pages) and <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lighthouse</a> (100/100).</p><p><a href="/assets/images/posts/jmperezperez-lighthouse.png"><img src="/assets/images/posts/jmperezperez-lighthouse.png" alt="Screenshot from Lighthouse for jmperezperez.com"></a></p><p>I’m looking forward to more ideas that I can apply to this blog and then some real project at scale :)</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Try this library, it’s the best thing ever. Try this technique, it will make your site automatically faster. I read and hear people praising libraries or technologies very often. It can come as a blog post, talk at a conference or informal conversation. It is fine to talk about the benefits of using A over B, but be alert if A doesn’t seem to have any drawbacks.</p><a id="more"></a><p><img src="/assets/images/posts/tools.jpg" alt="A picture of some tools"></p><p>I have done it myself. Most devs (at least web ones) are excited about the progress in network protocols, browser APIs and libraries amongst others. Gone are the days of building web sites for Netscape and &lt;IE6 with FrontPage, debugging with alerts, requesting many unminified files. I don’t want to go back to those days, and I hope you do not either.</p><p>It might be that I’m getting old, grumpy and boring. Or “experienced” might be the word. I even think it might have to do with web fatigue (à la JS).</p><p>HTTP/2, React, AMP, BEM… every new thing seems to fix the pains of our web sites. <strong>And we don’t do ourselves a favour when we jump on the bandwagon and amplify their benefits, without even trying them out</strong>. Without being capable of understanding the effects of embracing them. The negative effects.</p><p>We shouldn’t become sales people, but engineers with a toolset, aware of the limitations and trade-offs of each of them. <strong>No single tool is the best one for every project</strong>.</p><p>The contrary also happens many times. People will also criticise without having enough information, only because the general consensus is to be against it (eg using jQuery or Angular). Sometimes it looks like it’s a “with me or against me” situation.</p><h2 id="Trade-offs-and-nuances"><a href="#Trade-offs-and-nuances" class="headerlink" title="Trade-offs and nuances"></a>Trade-offs and nuances</h2><p>I appreciate it when people talk honestly about technology and don’t get driven by the idea that the new thing is always better. Sure, it has been created for a reason, probably to fill a gap or improve a specific aspect, but it will likely come with some problems.</p><p>Everything is fine when you are implementing <em>Hello World</em> (should I say also a <em>Todo app</em>)? However, it might not work for another project, like the one you are involved right now at your company. Those need to be stable, scalable, testable and maintainable.</p><h2 id="Talking-publicly-about-new-tech-conferences-and-blog-posts"><a href="#Talking-publicly-about-new-tech-conferences-and-blog-posts" class="headerlink" title="Talking publicly about new tech - conferences and blog posts"></a>Talking publicly about new tech - conferences and blog posts</h2><p>I find it quite valuable when someone talks about using a certain technology applied to a real project. They are usually stories about illusions, obstacles, work-arounds, trade-offs. Those are close to real life experiences than what most sources will claim.</p><p>Before recommending a solution, make sure you know about its drawbacks. Don’t limit yourself to describe its benefits. <strong>Tell how you tried to apply it, what issues you found and how you managed to solve or mitigate them</strong>.</p><p>I like watching recorded talks from web conferences. I think that the best talks are those about real projects where something went wrong. Basically, any real project. Even better when the speaker works at a medium-size company, where projects are big large enough to have representative issues, and the company is small enough so the speaker can give details openly.</p><p>If you need some examples, check out these talks:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WIDa5-bPDs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Mifsud’s “Real World HTTP/2”</a> on the effects of applying HTTP/2 to 99designs’s web site.</li><li>Vitaly Friedman’s “How We Moved To HTTP/2 To Improve Performance… And Failed” on how <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Smashing Magazine</a> was moved to HTTP/2 and had issues with web fonts and ads. Unfortunately, there is no recording, but his talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1--3T8y6Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cutting-Edge Responsive Web Design</a> covers some of these points.</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skzcEKewOwc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ally Palanzi’s Accessibility matters. Let’s do something about it</a> on how to drive awareness about accessibility at a company and make it part of the development workflow.</li><li><a href="https://vimeo.com/144499045" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Espen Brunborg, Gordon McLachlan and Bart Oleszczyk’s Walking the Tightrope Between Mediocrity and Bankruptcy</a> on the challenge to build good projects and keep clients happy.</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UsnX5X_DF0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Felipe Ribeiro’s JavaScript @ Spotify</a> on how Spotify embraced web to build the desktop client and the journey to balance teams autonomy and consistency in tech.</li></ul><p>In short, look for content explaining issues encountered while adopting that technology.</p><h2 id="Assessing-technology"><a href="#Assessing-technology" class="headerlink" title="Assessing technology"></a>Assessing technology</h2><p>When assessing a piece of technology like a library, framework, compression algorithm, etc, ask yourself these questions:</p><p><strong>How mature is it?</strong></p><p>In general, the longer it has been around, the more scenarios it’s been used on, more bugs have been fixed, more documentation is available and more people able to help you if issues arise.</p><blockquote><p>The nice thing about boringness (or constrained) is that the capabilities of these things are well understood. But more importantly, their failure modes are well understood — Dan McKinley on <a href="http://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Choose Boring Technology</a>.</p></blockquote><p>The fact that it is used by a large company definitely helps getting some backing. Still, that company might have resolved issues with tooling that won’t necessarily share publicly.</p><p><strong>What will be the technical problems if I use it for my project?</strong></p><p>Performance issues? Increase in build time? Dependencies you don’t control? Sooner than later you will need to dig into the internals of the technology to understand what is going on.</p><p><strong>Will it be embraced/enforced in my project?</strong></p><p>For this, other members in the project need to be knowledgeable so they can maintain it and apply it to new areas of the project. Otherwise it will become something you introduced that nobody feels comfortable with. That is why it is important to get buy-in from your colleagues, document the solutions and use tools like linters and checkers to enforce these solutions.</p><h2 id="Apply-it-to-a-small-project"><a href="#Apply-it-to-a-small-project" class="headerlink" title="Apply it to a small project"></a>Apply it to a small project</h2><p>I’m not saying you shouldn’t try out that new shiny thing.</p><p>Let’s say React seems to solve some problems you are facing in a project, or at least that’s what you think after seeing all the hype about Facebook’s library. Try building first a side project with it, or a prototype that resembles the project you are working on. Don’t skip aspects like expressiveness, debuggability, performance, testability and scalability. Sure, it’s going to be very difficult to know about these unless you make the project larger, or do some research.</p><p>If you can’t spend your free time on a side project, ask for some time to work on a prototype. It will help if you time-box it, so your colleagues and stakeholders can expect some conclusions on a given date. Some companies also arrange hack days, hackathons or something like Google’s 20% that you can use to experiment.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Let’s try to get more informed about how every tool fits in our projects, their limitations and how to choose the most suitable one given a set of constraints. Our approach should be analytical, and not get driven by the novelty or the feeling of a few people.</p>]]></content>

Pretty much only <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStream_Recording_API" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MDN</a> and <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/04/record-almost-everything-in-the-browser-with-mediarecorder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other post by Sole</a>. I thought this small experiment would also help those searching for some examples.</p><p><em>Note: As of December 2016 this demo is only supported on Firefox. Chrome is not supported out of the box, needing an extension and lots of custom code (see this WebRTC experiment for more information. It will show your camera, but won’t record anything.</em></p><h3 id="The-code"><a href="#The-code" class="headerlink" title="The code"></a>The code</h3><p>The code for the project is at <a href="https://github.com/JMPerez/screenflow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JMPerez/screenflow on GitHub</a> and a demo is available on <a href="https://jmperezperez.com/screenflow/">jmperezperez.com/screenflow</a>.</p><p>Let’s have a look at the most important code fragments. First of all, we define functions to request access to the different media sources:</p><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><div class="line"><span class="comment">// we ask for permission to record the window</span></div><div class="line"><span class="comment">// mediaSource could also be 'screen' if we wanted</span></div><div class="line"><span class="comment">// to record the entire screen</span></div><div class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> getStreamForWindow = <span class="function"><span class="params">()</span> =&gt;</span> navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia(&#123;</div><div class="line">  <span class="attr">video</span>: &#123;</div><div class="line">    <span class="attr">mediaSource</span>: <span class="string">'window'</span></div><div class="line">  &#125;</div><div class="line">&#125;);</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line"><span class="comment">// we ask for permission to record the audio and video from the camera</span></div><div class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> getStreamForCamera = <span class="function"><span class="params">()</span> =&gt;</span> navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia(&#123;</div><div class="line">   <span class="attr">audio</span>: <span class="literal">true</span></div><div class="line">&#125;);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Now, we execute them, one after the other one. I tried to execute both in parallel, believing that the browser would combine both requests in the permission dialog, but that didn’t work. So the idea is to request access to the webcam, insert a <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element with the media from the camera and then request access to the screen and record it.</p><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">getStreamForCamera().then(<span class="function"><span class="params">streamCamera</span> =&gt;</span> &#123;</div><div class="line">    <span class="comment">// we know have access to the camera, let's append it to the DOM</span></div><div class="line">    appendCamera(streamCamera);</div><div class="line">    getStreamForWindow().then(<span class="function"><span class="params">streamWindow</span> =&gt;</span> &#123;</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">      <span class="comment">// we now have access to the screen too</span></div><div class="line">      <span class="comment">// we generate a combined stream with the video from the</span></div><div class="line">      <span class="comment">// screen and the audio from the camera</span></div><div class="line">      <span class="keyword">var</span> finalStream = <span class="keyword">new</span> MediaStream();</div><div class="line">      <span class="keyword">const</span> videoTrack = streamWindow.getVideoTracks()[<span class="number">0</span>];</div><div class="line">      finalStream.addTrack(videoTrack);</div><div class="line">      <span class="keyword">const</span> audioTrack = streamCamera.getAudioTracks()[<span class="number">0</span>];</div><div class="line">      finalStream.addTrack(audioTrack);</div><div class="line">      <span class="keyword">this</span>.recorder = <span class="keyword">new</span> MediaRecorder(finalStream);</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">      <span class="comment">// we subscribe to 'ondataavailable'.</span></div><div class="line">      <span class="comment">// this gets called when the recording is stopped.</span></div><div class="line">      <span class="keyword">this</span>.recorder.ondataavailable = <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params">e</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class="line">        <span class="comment">// let's create a blob with e.data which has the</span></div><div class="line">        <span class="comment">// contents of the video in webm</span></div><div class="line">        <span class="keyword">var</span> link = <span class="built_in">document</span>.createElement(<span class="string">'a'</span>);</div><div class="line">        link.setAttribute(<span class="string">'href'</span>, <span class="built_in">window</span>.URL.createObjectURL(e.data));</div><div class="line">        link.setAttribute(<span class="string">'download'</span>, <span class="string">'video_'</span> + <span class="built_in">Math</span>.floor((<span class="built_in">Math</span>.random() * <span class="number">999999</span>)) + <span class="string">'.webm'</span>);</div><div class="line">        link.style.display = <span class="string">'none'</span>;</div><div class="line">        <span class="built_in">document</span>.body.appendChild(link);</div><div class="line">        link.click();</div><div class="line">        <span class="built_in">document</span>.body.removeChild(link);</div><div class="line">      &#125;</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">      <span class="comment">// start recording</span></div><div class="line">      <span class="keyword">this</span>.recorder.start();</div><div class="line">    &#125;);</div><div class="line">  &#125;);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Now, we finally need to call <code>this.recorder.stop()</code> whenever we want to stop the recording, which will make the browser save the file automatically. In my example, I’m attaching a key event listener for the “escape” key.</p><h3 id="A-note-about-permissions"><a href="#A-note-about-permissions" class="headerlink" title="A note about permissions"></a>A note about permissions</h3><p>In order to make this work you will need to whitelist the domain trying to record your screen. On Firefox, <code>localhost</code> will work out of the box. If you want to publish the code somewhere else, like GitHub Pages, make sure you whitelist it.</p><p>On Firefox, navigate to <code>about:config</code> and look for the key <code>media.getusermedia.screensharing.allowed_domains</code>. Add your domain to the list and restart the browser. Then, when you are running the code, the user will be able to grant access for both the webcam and the screen.</p><p>It is unclear whether this will be how a user lets a site record their screen, but it is how this works at the moment.</p><h3 id="A-step-further-making-this-embeddable"><a href="#A-step-further-making-this-embeddable" class="headerlink" title="A step further, making this embeddable"></a>A step further, making this embeddable</h3><p>The example code worked fine, but I wanted to take it a bit further. What if I wanted to use this “recording” functionality in more than one project? Also, given that the user has to whitelist a domain, we could serve the code from an <code>iframe</code> on that domain, so we wouldn’t need to add more domains to the <code>about:config</code>.</p><p>The final version of the prototype is based now on a script that you include on a page. The script appends an <code>iframe</code>, which executes the code we saw above and shows the output from the webcam at full size. Apart from the <code>iframe</code>, it also binds several key event listeners to toggle the visibility and size of the <code>iframe</code>.</p><p>These are the keys you can press to perform some actions:</p><ul><li>Escape: finishes the recording and saves the file</li><li>s: Switches the camera between full page and picture-in-picture</li><li>a: Toggles the visibility of the camera</li></ul><p>You can then include the script to any page to get this screen recording functionality. For instance, we can include <code>https://jmperezperez.com/screenflow/lib/embed.js</code> on a codepen and record a screencast.</p><h3 id="Limitations"><a href="#Limitations" class="headerlink" title="Limitations"></a>Limitations</h3><p>Keep in mind this is only a proof of concept and doesn’t have any real utility. If you are serious about recording a screencast, don’t use this hack :)</p><p>There are, of course, some limitations:</p><ul><li>The iframe with the camera is shown on top of the hosting page, but it will be hidden if we put some other window on top.</li><li>If we navigate from the hosting page to somewhere else we will lose the recording. This can be workaround by having, in the hosting page, an iframe for the camera and another iframe for the page we are recording, in full screen</li><li>If we click on the iframe with the camera, the key events will stop working because the hosting page doesn’t receive those. This can be solved sending <code>postMessage</code>s from the iframe to the hosting page.</li></ul>]]></content>
