    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m passionate about image performance optimisation and making images load fast on the web. One of the most interesting areas of exploration is placeholders: what to show when the image hasn’t loaded yet.</p><p>During the last days I have come across some loading techniques that use SVG, and I would like to describe them in this post.</p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto,f_auto,c_scale/v1509278557/jmperez-composition-primitive_j8zyfn.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px"> <small class="caption">Generating SVGs from images can be used for placeholders.

When doing lazy-loading of images it’s a good idea to think about what to render as a placeholder, since it can have a big impact in user’s perceived performance. In the past I described several options:</p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto,f_auto,c_scale/v1509278557/placeholder-options_vtwp6b.png" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px"> <small class="caption">Several strategies to fill the area of an image before it loads.</small></p><ul><li><strong>Keeping the space empty for the image</strong>: In a world of responsive design, this prevents content from jumping around. Those layout changes are bad from a user’s experience point of view, but also for performance. The browser is forced to do layout re calculations every time it fetches the dimensions of an image, leaving space for it.</li><li><strong>Placeholder</strong>: Imagine that we are displaying a user’s profile image. We might want to display a silhouette in the background. This is shown while the main image is loaded, but also when that request failed or when the user didn’t set any profile picture at all. These images are usually vector-based, and due to their small size are a good candidate to be inlined.</li><li><strong>Solid colour</strong>: Take a colour from the image and use it as the background colour for the placeholder. This can be the dominant colour, the most vibrant… The idea is that it is based on the image you are loading and should help making the transition between no image to image loaded smoother.</li><li><strong>Blurry image</strong>: Also called blur-up technique. You render a tiny version of the image and then transition to the full one. The initial image is tiny both in pixels and kBs. To remove artifacts the image is scaled up and blurred.</li></ul><p>Turns out there are many other variations and lots of smart people are developing other techniques to create placeholders.</p><p>One of them is having gradients instead of solid colours. The gradients can create a more accurate preview of the final image, with very little overhead (increase in payload).</p><p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto,f_auto,c_scale/v1509278575/gradient-background_jyymty.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 684px" alt="Using gradients as backgrounds. Screenshot from Gradify"> <small class="caption">Using gradients as backgrounds. Screenshot from Gradify, which is not online anymore. Code <a href="https://github.com/SilverStripers/gradify" target="_blank" rel="external">on GitHub</a>.</small></p><p>Another technique is using SVGs based on the image, which is getting some traction with recent experiments and hacks.</p><h3 id="SVG-based-placeholders"><a href="#SVG-based-placeholders" class="headerlink" title="SVG-based placeholders"></a>SVG-based placeholders</h3><p>We know SVGs are ideal for vector images. In most cases we want to load a bitmap one, so the question is how to vectorise an image. Some options are using edges, shapes and areas.</p><h4 id="Edges"><a href="#Edges" class="headerlink" title="Edges"></a>Edges</h4><p>In <a href="/drawing-edges-svg">a previous post</a> I explained how to find out the edges of an image and create an animation. My initial goal was to try to draw regions, vectorising the image, but I didn’t know how to do it. I realised that using the edges could also be innovative and I decided to animate them creating a “drawing” effect.</p><div class="codepen-aspect-ratio" style="margin-bottom: 10px; padding-bottom: 100%; position: relative; width: 100%"><iframe id="cp_embed_oogqdp" src="//codepen.io/jmperez/embed/oogqdp?height=600&theme-id=0&slug-hash=oogqdp&default-tab=result" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" height="600" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" class="cp_embed_iframe" data-amp-width="600" style="width: 600; overflow: hidden"></iframe></div><h4 id="Shapes"><a href="#Shapes" class="headerlink" title="Shapes"></a>Shapes</h4><p>SVG can also be used to draw areas from the image instead of edges/borders. In a way, we would vectorise a bitmap image to create a placeholder.</p><p>Back in the days I tried to do something similar with triangles. You can see the result in my talks <a href="/cssconfau16/#/45">at CSSConf</a> and <a href="/renderconf17/#/46">Render Conf</a>.</p><div class="codepen-aspect-ratio" style="margin-bottom: 10px; padding-bottom: 74%; position: relative; width: 100%"><iframe id="cp_embed_BmaWmQ" src="//codepen.io/jmperez/embed/BmaWmQ?height=444&theme-id=0&slug-hash=BmaWmQ&default-tab=result" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" height="444" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" class="cp_embed_iframe" data-amp-width="600" style="width: 600; overflow: hidden"></iframe></div><p>The codepen above is a proof of concept of a SVG-based placeholder composed of 245 triangles. The generation of the triangles is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation" target="_blank" rel="external">Delaunay triangulation</a> using <a href="https://github.com/possan/polyserver" target="_blank" rel="external">Possan’s polyserver</a>. As expected, the more triangles the SVG uses, the bigger the file size.</p><h4 id="Primitive-and-SQIP-a-SVG-based-LQIP-technique"><a href="#Primitive-and-SQIP-a-SVG-based-LQIP-technique" class="headerlink" title="Primitive and SQIP, a SVG-based LQIP technique"></a>Primitive and SQIP, a SVG-based LQIP technique</h4><p>Tobias Baldauf has been working on another Low-Quality Image Placeholder technique using SVGs called <a href="https://github.com/technopagan/sqip" target="_blank" rel="external">SQIP</a>. Before digging into SQIP itself I will give an overview of <a href="https://github.com/fogleman/primitive" target="_blank" rel="external">Primitive</a>, a library on which SQIP is based.</p><p>Primitive is quite fascinating and I definitely recommend you to check it out. It converts a bitmap image into a SVG composed of overlapping shapes. Its small size makes it suitable for inlining it straight into the page. One less roundtrip, and a meaningful placeholder within the initial HTML payload.</p><p>Primitive generates an image based on shapes like triangles, rectangles and circles (and a few others). In every step it adds a new one. The more steps, the resulting image looks closer to the original one. If your output is SVG it also means the size of the output code will be larger.</p><p>In order to understand how Primitive works, I ran it through a couple of images. I generated SVGs for the artwork using 10 shapes and 100 shapes:</p><div><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto,f_auto,c_scale/v1509367394/pexels-photo-281184-square-10.svg_ifiu2z.png" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 33vw, 228px" alt="Processing a picture through Primitive using 10 shapes" style="width:32%;float:left;margin-right:2%;padding-bottom:10px"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto,f_auto,c_scale/v1509367394/pexels-photo-281184-square-100.svg_tkr8el.png" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 33vw, 228px" alt="Processing a picture through Primitive using 100 shapes" style="width:32%;float:left;margin-right:2%;padding-bottom:10px"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto,f_auto,c_scale/v1509367395/pexels-photo-281184-square_tuhvso.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 33vw, 228px" alt="Original picture" style="width:32%;float:left;padding-bottom:10px"></div><p><small class="caption">Processing <a href="/assets/images/posts/svg-placeholders/pexels-photo-281184-square.jpg">this picture</a> using Primitive, using <a href="/assets/images/posts/svg-placeholders/pexels-photo-281184-square-10.svg">10 shapes</a> and <a href="/assets/images/posts/svg-placeholders/pexels-photo-281184-square-100.svg">100 shapes</a>.</small></p><div><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto,f_auto,c_scale/v1509367394/pexels-photo-618463-square-10.svg_aeonon.png" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 33vw, 228px" alt="Processing a picture through Primitive using 10 shapes" style="width:32%;float:left;margin-right:2%;padding-bottom:10px"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto,f_auto,c_scale/v1509367394/pexels-photo-618463-square-100.svg_t6pwcv.png" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 33vw, 228px" alt="Processing a picturethrough Primitive using 100 shapes" style="width:32%;float:left;margin-right:2%;padding-bottom:10px"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/jmperez/image/upload/w_auto,f_auto,c_scale/v1509367395/pexels-photo-618463-square_pmbi9x.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 33vw, 228px" alt="Original picture" style="width:32%;float:left;padding-bottom:10px"></div><p><small class="caption">Processing <a href="/assets/images/posts/svg-placeholders/pexels-photo-618463-square.jpg">this picture</a> using Primitive, using <a href="/assets/images/posts/svg-placeholders/pexels-photo-618463-square-10.svg">10 shapes</a> and <a href="/assets/images/posts/svg-placeholders/pexels-photo-618463-square-100.svg">100 shapes</a>.</small></p><p>When using 10 shapes the images we start getting a grasp of the original image.

They have a great level of detail with a still small payload. The decision of how many triangles to use will depend largely on the type of image (eg contrast, amount of colours, complexity) and level of detail.</p><p>It would be possible to create a script similar to <a href="https://github.com/technopagan/cjpeg-dssim" target="_blank" rel="external">cpeg-dssim</a> that tweaks the amount of shapes used until a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_similarity" target="_blank" rel="external">structural similarity</a> threshold is met (or a maximum number of shapes in the worst case).</p><p>These resulting SVGs are great also to use as background images. Being size-constrained and vector-based they are a good candidate for hero images and large backgrounds that otherwise would show artifacts.</p><h4 id="SQIP"><a href="#SQIP" class="headerlink" title="SQIP"></a>SQIP</h4><p>In <a href="https://github.com/technopagan/sqip" target="_blank" rel="external">Tobias’ own words</a>:</p><blockquote><p>SQIP is an attempt to find a balance between these two extremes: it makes use of <a href="https://github.com/fogleman/primitive" target="_blank" rel="external">Primitive</a> to generate a SVG consisting of several simple shapes that approximate the main features visible inside the image, optimizes the SVG using <a href="https://github.com/svg/svgo" target="_blank" rel="external">SVGO</a> and adds a Gaussian Blur filter to it. This produces a SVG placeholder which weighs in at only ~800–1000 bytes, looks smooth on all screens and provides an visual cue of image contents to come.</p></blockquote><p>The result is similar to using a tiny placeholder image for the blur-up technique (what <a href="/medium-image-progressive-loading-placeholder">Medium</a> and <a href="/more-progressive-image-loading">other sites</a> do). The difference is that instead of using a bitmap image, eg JPG or WebP, the placeholder is SVG.</p><p>If we run SQIP against the original images we’ll get this:</p><div><img

It was truly international, with all talks delivered in English (something unusual in Spain) and 250 attendees from 25+ countries.</p><p>The most impressive is that <strong>it was arranged by 2 Spanish expats who form the company <a href="https://limenius.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Limenius</a>, based in Munich</strong>. <a href="https://twitter.com/nacmartin" target="_blank" rel="external">Nacho</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/vicqr" target="_blank" rel="external">Victoria</a> did an impressive job, putting together a top-level conference with a great line-up and contents. They managed to prove that its possible to arrange a good conference in a well-communicated location like Alicante, with good weather and interesting attractions, while making it affordable (the regular tickets for the talks were 99).</p><p><img src="/assets/images/posts/react-alicante-nacho-martin.jpg" alt="Nacho Martín speaking at React Alicante"> <small class="caption">Nacho Martín speaking at React Alicante</small></p><p><img src="/assets/images/posts/react-alicante-flavio-corpa.jpg" alt="Falvio Corpa speaking at React Alicante"> <small class="caption">Flavio Corpa during his talk</small></p><p><img src="/assets/images/posts/react-alicante-overview.jpg" alt="Overview of React Alicante"> <small class="caption">General overview of the full room</small></p><p>There were several talks touching on style guides and the difficult world of creating UI components that can be customisable in options and theming. Other topics were forms, CSS in JS, Redux/Mobx, code splitting, GraphQL, and React Native.</p><p>They covered pretty well the current ecosystem of tools when working with React, and they shared learnings that can be applied to our daily jobs.</p><p>Do you want more details about the talks?

In short, it lets machines do what they are best at.</p><p>The talk covers a topic that is really hot at the moment. In fact several other talks also brought up the idea of moving the styles within the components to help with maintainability, theming and critical css rendering.

Some examples are the lack of automatic refresh of the app when changing the system language, or doing data synchronisation when the app is in the background.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week I had a blast speaking at <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Alicante-Frontend/events/242461990/" target="_blank" rel="external">a meetup organised by Alicante Frontend</a>. To me this was really special. Alicante is my home town and it’s also where I studied Computer Science.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/posts/alicante-frontend.jpg" alt="Alicante Frontend"></p><a id="more"></a><p>After having been far from the region for some time, I was happy to catch up with some colleagues and confirm that web development is really healthy in Alicante. There are more companies, co-working spaces, meetups and conferences than ever. There is a feeling of collaboration and helping each other that will continue fostering good things.</p><h2 id="Visiting-ULab"><a href="#Visiting-ULab" class="headerlink" title="Visiting ULab"></a>Visiting ULab</h2><p><img src="/assets/images/posts/ulab.jpg" alt="Entrance of ULab — taken from ulab.es"> <small class="caption">Entrance of ULab — taken from <a href="https://ulab.es" target="_blank" rel="external">ulab.es</a></small></p><p>The meetup was hosted at <a href="https://ulab.es/" target="_blank" rel="external">ULab</a>, a coworking space in the centre of Alicante. They offer desks, offices, training rooms and meeting rooms for rent, and have been hosting Alicante Frontend meetups.</p><p>I had the chance to meet with <a href="http://www.soyisabelromero.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Isabel Romer</a>, Product Manager at ULab, who showed me the facilities. We talked about the ecosystem of companies in the area and how Alicante is becoming a hub of tech start-ups.</p><p>The space reminded me of <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/event-space" target="_blank" rel="external">CodeNode London</a>, though a bit smaller (1,300 vs 2,100 sqm). I had heard of a few co-working spaces in the region but whenever I checked their website it felt like old offices recycled as mere desks for rent, not taking advantage of an eco-system of companies and professionals collaborating with each other, nor hosting external events.</p><p>I was actually looking for a place like this. I have tried to work remotely sporadically while spending some days in Alicante visiting my family. I’ll definitely try it out when coming back.</p><h2 id="Meeting-the-team-behind-Alicante-Frontend"><a href="#Meeting-the-team-behind-Alicante-Frontend" class="headerlink" title="Meeting the team behind Alicante Frontend"></a>Meeting the team behind Alicante Frontend</h2><p><img src="/assets/images/posts/alicante-frontend-organisers.jpg" alt="Alex Jover, me, Alex Mayol and Álvaro Yuste.

They have been arranging events since December 2016 and are very active on Twitter, GitHub and the aforementioned Slack channels.</p><h2 id="The-talk"><a href="#The-talk" class="headerlink" title="The talk"></a>The talk</h2><p>I talked about web performance optimisation focused on images. The talk was based on the one I gave at JSDayES, but this time I translated it to Spanish.</p><p>Here are <a href="https://slides.com/jmperez/pir-alicante-frontend" target="_blank" rel="external">the slides</a>:</p><div class="videoWrapper"><iframe src="//slides.com/jmperez/pir-alicante-frontend/embed" width="576" height="420" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>There were many questions in the Q&amp;A. Some of them were related with the contents of the talk, like how to tackle retina displays, some doubts about lazy loading and whether I had been using Service Workers in my projects at Spotify.</p><p>Lots of other questions were about Spotify and Sweden. How is it working at Spotify, what the culture is like, how we are organised or how we work with designers were a few ones. Also whether it’s very cold and there are lots of depressed people in Sweden. If you wonder, it’s not that cold, at least in Stockholm, and darkness can affect your humour but you’ll probably be fine.</p><p>There were around 60 attendees, and I was told this was the most crowded meetup organised by Alicante Frontend, which made me extra happy.</p><p>I’m sure Alicante Frontend will continue growing and showcasing the local talent.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a post about a hack project I have been working on lately, and I wanted to share some information about why and how I built it.</p><p>tl;dr <a href="https://c-spotify.herokuapp.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Here is <strong>the demo</strong></a> and <a href="https://github.com/JMPerez/c" target="_blank" rel="external"><strong>the project on GitHub</strong></a>.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/posts/c-collaborative.png" alt="C, collaborative room to listen to Spotify"></p><a id="more"></a><p><small class="caption">A screenshot of C, a simple collaborative room built using Spotify’s Web API.</small></p><h3 id="Collaborative-listening"><a href="#Collaborative-listening" class="headerlink" title="Collaborative listening"></a>Collaborative listening</h3><p>The idea is basic. You go to a page where you can propose songs to listen to, and other people do the same thing. The playback is synchronised for all users that are connected in that moment.</p><p>These pages are called “rooms”, and are normally based on some genre, to guide users when proposing songs. You don’t want to hear “Despacito” in a the latest rock album in a “80s Classic Hits“ room. The songs that are going to play next, which are in a queue, can also be voted up (sometimes down too). Great if you don’t feel like proposing new songs but you see one you like in the proposed ones.</p><p>As I said, this is not new at all, and in fact it was part of Spotify’s desktop application since <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apvqiFsJcas" target="_blank" rel="external">end of 2011</a>, as an app called Soundrop:</p><div class="videoWrapper"><iframe width="720" height="405" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cavizRODpL0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p><small class="caption">Video showing the Soundrop Spotify App.</small></p><p>The app was based on the now defunct <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/apps/" target="_blank" rel="external">Spotify Apps API</a>. This set of tools allowed custom web apps to run in an isolated view on Spotify’s desktop application, being able to control playback and user’s library.</p><p>Soundrop as a collaborative app is no more. After the removal of the Apps API <a href="http://www.show.co/blog/heavy-hearts" target="_blank" rel="external">they pivoted to a different product</a>.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/posts/spotify-app-finder.jpg" alt="Spotify App Finder"></p><p><small class="caption">List of the initial Spotify Apps. Source: <a href="http://evolver.fm/2011/12/02/spotify-apps-slated-to-roll-out-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="external">evolver.fm</a></small></p><p>The Apps API was the first project I worked on when I joined in Spotify in 2012. I would review submissions, support developers that had questions about how to use it, and create example apps.</p><p>The project <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2014/11/13/rip-spotify-apps-rip-soundrop/" target="_blank" rel="external">was discontinued end of 2014</a>, and with it these integrations. The Apps API were replaced by mobile SDKs (<a href="https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/spotify-ios-sdk/" target="_blank" rel="external">iOS</a> and <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/spotify-android-sdk/" target="_blank" rel="external">Android</a>) and a <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/" target="_blank" rel="external">REST API</a>, which we called Web API. The Web API had endpoints for fetching metadata and managing the user’s library through some scopes. If you have ever consumed any other API using OAuth 2.0, this one follows the same approach.</p><p>Though there were many endpoints added through the time, it was still impossible to control the playback through the API. This changed recently with the release of <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/web-api-connect-endpoint-reference/" target="_blank" rel="external">the Connect endpoints</a>.</p><h3 id="Spotify-Connect"><a href="#Spotify-Connect" class="headerlink" title="Spotify Connect"></a>Spotify Connect</h3><p>Say you are playing music on your phone. You arrive home and want to start playing on your desktop application. You can transfer the playback from the phone to the desktop, which will pick it up from that moment. The combination phone ↔ desktop works also with speakers, video consoles and the Web Player, which makes this very powerful. These capabilities are called <a href="https://www.spotify.com/connect/" target="_blank" rel="external">Connect</a>.</p><p>The Connect endpoints allow you to list the devices available for the user and transfer the playback between them. The set of endpoints is still in beta and subject to change, but it’s handy to work on a few hacks.</p><h4 id="Now-Playing"><a href="#Now-Playing" class="headerlink" title="Now Playing"></a>Now Playing</h4><p>A few weeks ago <a href="/spotify-connect-api">I published a post talking about a small library I built to fetch what you are playing on Spotify</a>. The library is handy for not having to deal with the authorisation flow, and makes it easy to crease visualisations such as <a href="https://codepen.io/jmperez/full/MmwObE" target="_blank" rel="external">this one</a>:</p><iframe id="cp_embed_MmwObE" src="//codepen.io/jmperez/embed/MmwObE?height=389&theme-id=0&slug-hash=MmwObE&default-tab=result" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" height="389" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" class="cp_embed_iframe" data-amp-width="100%" style="width: 100%; overflow: hidden"></iframe><p>I created some other visualisations and organised them on <a href="https://codepen.io/collection/AyVBYB" target="_blank" rel="external">this Codepen collection</a>.</p><h3 id="Implementing-basic-collaborative-listening-with-Connect"><a href="#Implementing-basic-collaborative-listening-with-Connect" class="headerlink" title="Implementing basic collaborative listening with Connect"></a>Implementing basic collaborative listening with Connect</h3><p>Now that we’ve gone through an overview of what we want to accomplish and what tools we have available, let’s go for it.</p><p>When you log in with your Spotify account you will enter a room where y<strong>ou can add songs and let the website control your playback</strong> (you should have a Spotify application opened, like the mobile app, desktop app or <a href="https://open.spotify.com" target="_blank" rel="external">web player</a>)</p><p>If you think about it, <strong>a room for adding songs is basically a chat room</strong>. Instead of sending regular text messages you send commands like “add song” or “remove song” and the server makes sure all connected users get the updates and are kept in sync.</p><p>One use case is using the demo only as a controller, and not a speaker. Imagine that we have a speaker at work. We might want to queue songs but not having them playing from our computer. That’s what the mute/unmute button does. It will mute or stop syncing your playback with the room’s playback.</p><p>Another feature, or lack of it, is that the controller is the web site and not the server. <strong>Your playback will be synced with the room as long as you have the website open</strong>. This could be changed by letting the server make these requests on your behalf. After all, it has access to your refresh token when logging in. However, it’s easy to forget that you didn’t log out from the demo and freak out when something is changing your playback randomly, so that’s why I didn’t take this approach.</p><p>A limitation is that the project only works with Spotify Premium accounts, <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/working-with-connect/#Premium%20Only" target="_blank" rel="external">due to this restriction on the Connect endpoints</a>. You can still add songs, but the “play” command won’t work if your account is a free one.</p><p><strong>The Robot</strong></p><p>You are not alone in the room. <strong>A bot called “Robot” is always online</strong>, taking care of adding songs to the queue when it gets empty, based on previous submitted songs by users.</p><p>The data is provided by the Web API through its <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-recommendations/" target="_blank" rel="external">Get Recommendations Based on Seeds</a> endpoint. This endpoint returns a list of tracks that are based on a list of artists, genres and tracks, and you can set constraints on many music attributes.</p><p>Thus, you could want the Robot to put more energetic music on Fridays. Or have a robot adding recommendations based on Rock music in a Rock room. For this one, check out <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-recommendations/#available-genre-seeds" target="_blank" rel="external">the list of available genre seeds</a>. At the moment there are 126 genres of them. Not bad!</p><p><strong>Future?</strong></p><p>The demo is basic. The design is unpolished and the site is limited to a single room. However, it’s easy to deploy on a custom instance and the main goal is to serve to others that want to integrate with Spotify’s APIs. It’s open source, so you can fork it and do as you wish.</p><p>The project would be easy to tweak to cover other use cases. One of them would be <strong>synchronised sessions</strong>. Say I listen to great music (no, I don’t) and someone wants to tune in and listen exactly to what I’m listening to. You <em>just</em> need to assume every publishing user is a room, listen to changes in user’s playback and publish them, synchronising the subscribed users.</p><h3 id="Nerdy-details"><a href="#Nerdy-details" class="headerlink" title="Nerdy details"></a>Nerdy details</h3><p>The project uses React + Redux for rendering, and Node in the backend,this is all done using <a href="https://github.com/zeit/next.js/" target="_blank" rel="external">Next.js</a>, which also make Server-Side Rendering easy. An additional tweak is that React is replaced with Preact in production for a smaller payload. The whole thing is deployed on a Heroku instance.</p><p>One of the reasons I wanted to hack on Next.js was to have a better picture of its overhead. For this hack, the main page loads a bundle for the index page that is ~2.8kB minified &amp; gzipped, and the common bundle which is 80.6kB minified &amp; gzipped. It’s not the lightest alternative, but <strong>Next.js is designed to scale well as you add more pages to your site</strong>, due to how the bundles are split per page out of the box. Adding a large component to one page will not have an impact in the JS loaded for another page.</p><p>I have played with several ideas in the code base, that’s why it’s not very uniform and you’ll see, for example, several ways of doing CSS-in-JS.</p><p>I use this kind of hacks to give some new libraries and techniques a try, making them part of my tool belt and maybe using them in some real project. It’s also good to give Spotify’s Web API folks some feedback about the endpoints.</p><p>Regarding Next.js this project was pretty much an excuse to try out this library/framework. Yes, I could have picked any other project but my ideas always gravitate around Spotify-stuff. I wanted to see how opinionated it was, how SSR worked in that page-component pattern they use, and how it feels working with it.</p><h4 id="Why-Next-js"><a href="#Why-Next-js" class="headerlink" title="Why Next.js"></a>Why Next.js</h4><p>If you’ve ever tried to set up your own React.JS + ES6 + Webpack + react-intl + whatnot and have succeed without sweating, I’m your fan. Whenever I try, I always end up using some boilerplate project with everything in place.</p><p>I like <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app" target="_blank" rel="external">create-react-app</a>. It makes everything so easier, and you can always go leave the wizard mode by eject-ing. No lock-in.</p><p>I have been following Next.js from the distance. I would read about it, but never had the time nor the energy to give it a try. I decided it was about time I put it in practice.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/posts/learn-nextjs.png" alt="Learn Next.js"></p><p><small class="caption"><a href="https://learnnextjs.com" target="_blank" rel="external">learnnext.js</a> is a great interactive step-by-step tutorial. If I ever write a library I’ll make sure the tutorial is as great as the library itself, so it’s easy to learn and adopt.</small></p><p>I started reading a bit and followed <a href="https://learnnextjs.com" target="_blank" rel="external">LearnNext.js</a>. I found it too basic at first, then I jumped to the code, but quickly had to go back to the tutorial. It’s good not to take shortcuts. Their tutorial might seem easy but there are some concepts that are important, or you face problems soon.</p><p>The best resource I found for Next.js is <a href="https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/master/examples" target="_blank" rel="external">the examples folder in their repo</a>. It’s pure gold. Lots of concise examples of how to use Next.js with pretty much anything. Pick ’n’ mix. I wanted to combine express + preact + redux + socket.io, and I had examples there for all of this.</p><p>I would say the most difficult part is when you realise that part of your code is running on the server. It’s quite surprising, but it’s what SSR is about. <code>localStorage</code> and <code>fetch</code> would fail, and other browser-only properties we are used to access when working with JS.</p><p>Overall I’m really happy. Most of your code is the same and you only need to adapt a bit to their routing. That’s what I like the most. It gives you the glue to put everything together, but you can still use the tools you are used to.</p><p>Zeit’s project are really awesome. Simple but extremely useful.</p><p>If you haven’t done it yet, have a look at <a href="https://c-spotify.herokuapp.com" target="_blank" rel="external"><strong>the demo</strong></a> and <a href="https://github.com/JMPerez/c" target="_blank" rel="external"><strong>the project on GitHub</strong></a>.</p>]]></content>

It’s a really good post about <code>outline</code>, that CSS property lots of devs tend to hide. The post explains some a11y-friendly alternatives to not display it, and show it when needed.</p><a id="more"></a><p>In the past I have made the same mistake of hiding the <code>outline</code> altogether, but no more!</p><p>A few months ago I came across a similar technique David Gilbertson describes, while inspecting the markup on Youtube.com. They take accessibility seriously and their player is a very good example to get inspiration from.</p><p>I then applied it to one of the Spotify sites I work on. Take <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2ZBNclC5wm4GtiWaeh0DMx?fo=1" target="_blank" rel="external">this Spotify page as an example</a>. This is how it works:</p><ol><li>Add a <code>no-focus-outline</code> CSS class to the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element.</li><li>Hide the outline using CSS only in <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> elements that descend from that class.</li><li>When tabbing, remove the CSS class.</li></ol><p>The complete code:</p><p><strong>CSS</strong><figure class="highlight css"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><div class="line"><span class="selector-class">.no-focus-outline</span> <span class="selector-tag">a</span><span class="selector-pseudo">:focus</span>,</div><div class="line"><span class="selector-class">.no-focus-outline</span> <span class="selector-tag">button</span><span class="selector-pseudo">:focus</span> &#123;</div><div class="line">  <span class="attribute">outline</span>: none;</div><div class="line">&#125;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p><strong>JS</strong><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><div class="line"><span class="comment">// Listen to tab events to enable outlines (accessibility improvement)</span></div><div class="line"><span class="built_in">document</span>.body.addEventListener(<span class="string">'keyup'</span>, <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params">e</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class="line">  <span class="keyword">if</span> (e.which === <span class="number">9</span>) <span class="comment">/* tab */</span> &#123;</div><div class="line">    <span class="built_in">document</span>.documentElement.classList.remove(<span class="string">'no-focus-outline'</span>);</div><div class="line">  &#125;</div><div class="line">&#125;);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p><p>And a video showing what it looks like when tabbing:</p><div style="text-align:center"><video width="320" height="560" controls><source src="/assets/images/posts/css-outline-focus.webm" type="video/webm"><source src="/assets/images/posts/css-outline-focus.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></div><p>Some additional a11y improvements are that I apply the same effect on hover and on focus, like when going through the “More by …” albums section. Last, but not least, the track row acts as a button to start the playback.</p><p>These are some small touches that very few people will realise, but are not difficult to implement and can have a very positive impact for some users.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The web ecosystem is maturing and every day we understand better how to architecture large and maintainable web applications. We also understand what makes our sites slower and are coming up with solutions to overcome this.</p><p>Building a complex site that can work on slow networks is a challenge.

They have in common that they are well known in the developed world, and also that they have embraced the web as the channel to reach users in emerging markets. Not as a basic site with a large modal to download the app, but with a full-feature experience. After all, web users shouldn’t be considered second-class citizens.</p><p>Twitter has been great at talking about implementation details (see <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2017/introducing-twitter-lite.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Introducing Twitter Lite</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@paularmstrong/twitter-lite-and-high-performance-react-progressive-web-apps-at-scale-d28a00e780a3" target="_blank" rel="external">Twitter Lite and High Performance React Progressive Web Apps at Scale</a>) which is really helpful for devs like me who face some of these challenges on a daily basis.

They recently <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/05/09/instagram-mobile-website-upload-photos/" target="_blank" rel="external">added photo upload</a> to their mobile site in a clear sign of their investment on the platform, but haven’t shared details about how the tech behind the site. Tinder is a similar case, with <a href="http://blog.gotinder.com/introducing-tinder-online/" target="_blank" rel="external">a newer website</a>.</p><p>And a couple of days ago it was Uber with <a href="https://eng.uber.com/m-uber/" target="_blank" rel="external">Building m.uber: Engineering a high-performance web app for the global market</a>.

    <title>PerformanceObserver and Paint Timing API</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2017/06/chrome-60-beta-paint-timing-api-css.html" target="_blank" rel="external">a recent post about Chrome 60 Beta</a>, Google announced the support of the Paint Timing API to get metrics on when your page starts rendering and when the user gets content that can be consumed (more info on the definition of the events below). Here I’m going to describe this new API a bit and show you how to use it.</p><a id="more"></a><p><img src="/assets/images/posts/paint-timing-example.png" alt="Example of Paint Timing API entries"></p><p><small class="caption">Image taken from the <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2017/06/chrome-60-beta-paint-timing-api-css.html" target="_blank" rel="external">Chrome 60 blog post</a>, which first appeared in <a href="https://youtu.be/6Ljq-Jn-EgU" target="_blank" rel="external">“Web Performance: Leveraging the Metrics that Most Affect User Experience”</a> at Google I/O 2017</small></p><p>Up until now we have been measuring performance through other metrics, mostly using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Navigation_timing_API" target="_blank" rel="external">Navigation Timing API</a>, which is also what Google Analytics uses for their <a href="http://www.ericmobley.net/measuring-performance-google-analytics/" target="_blank" rel="external">Site Speed report</a>. Yet those metrics don’t tell us the whole picture about the rendering experience.</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/WICG/paint-timing" target="_blank" rel="external">Paint Timing API</a> aims to improve this by exposing metrics on paint events that are grouped in two types of entries. By <a href="https://github.com/WICG/paint-timing#definition" target="_blank" rel="external">its definition</a>:</p><ul><li><code>&quot;first-paint&quot;</code> entries contain a <code>DOMHighResTimeStamp</code> reporting the time when the browser first rendered after navigation. This excludes the default background paint, but includes non-default background paint. This is the first key moment developers care about in page load – when the browser has started to render the page.</li><li><code>&quot;first-contentful-paint&quot;</code> contain a <code>DOMHighResTimestamp</code> reporting the time when the browser first rendered any text, image (including background images), non-white canvas or SVG. This includes text with pending webfonts. This is the first time users could start consuming page content.</li></ul><p>A picture is worth a thousand words, so let’s see how these entries would be reported by some real web sites: <img src="/assets/images/posts/paint-timing-filmstrip.png" alt="Filmstrip from several sites showing when Paint Timing API entries are triggered"></p><p><small class="caption">Image taken from the <a href="https://github.com/WICG/paint-timing#examples" target="_blank" rel="external">Paint timing API repo on WICG</a>.</small></p><h4 id="Hacking-on-it"><a href="#Hacking-on-it" class="headerlink" title="Hacking on it"></a>Hacking on it</h4><p>As a hack project I decided to give it a try and implement it on a web site. You have a basic example <a href="https://github.com/WICG/paint-timing#usage" target="_blank" rel="external">on the Paint timing page</a>:</p><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><div class="line"><span class="keyword">var</span> observer = <span class="keyword">new</span> PerformanceObserver(<span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params">list</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class="line">  <span class="keyword">var</span> perfEntries = list.getEntries();</div><div class="line">  <span class="keyword">for</span> (<span class="keyword">var</span> i = <span class="number">0</span>; i &lt; perfEntries.length; i++) &#123;</div><div class="line">     <span class="comment">// Process entries</span></div><div class="line">     <span class="comment">// report back for analytics and monitoring</span></div><div class="line">     <span class="comment">// ...</span></div><div class="line">  &#125;</div><div class="line">&#125;);</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line"><span class="comment">// register observer for long task notifications</span></div><div class="line">observer.observe(&#123;<span class="attr">entryTypes</span>: [<span class="string">"paint"</span>]&#125;);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>In practice you will probably want to report the information somewhere you can track it. If you are using Google Analytics, you can use <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/06/user-centric-performance-metrics#tracking_fpfcp" target="_blank" rel="external">this snippet from Google’s Developer site</a> (ES6):</p><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><div class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> observer = <span class="keyword">new</span> PerformanceObserver(<span class="function">(<span class="params">list</span>) =&gt;</span> &#123;</div><div class="line">  <span class="keyword">for</span> (<span class="keyword">const</span> entry <span class="keyword">of</span> list.getEntries()) &#123;</div><div class="line">    <span class="comment">// `name` will be either 'first-paint' or 'first-contentful-paint'.</span></div><div class="line">    <span class="keyword">const</span> metricName = entry.name;</div><div class="line">    <span class="keyword">const</span> time = <span class="built_in">Math</span>.round(entry.startTime + entry.duration);</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">    ga(<span class="string">'send'</span>, <span class="string">'event'</span>, &#123;</div><div class="line">      <span class="attr">eventCategory</span>: <span class="string">'Performance Metrics'</span>,</div><div class="line">      <span class="attr">eventAction</span>: metricName,</div><div class="line">      <span class="attr">eventValue</span>: time,</div><div class="line">      <span class="attr">nonInteraction</span>: <span class="literal">true</span>,</div><div class="line">    &#125;);</div><div class="line">  &#125;</div><div class="line">&#125;);</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line"><span class="comment">// Start observing paint entries.</span></div><div class="line">observer.observe(&#123;<span class="attr">entryTypes</span>: [<span class="string">'paint'</span>]&#125;);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h4 id="Word-of-Caution"><a href="#Word-of-Caution" class="headerlink" title="Word of Caution"></a>Word of Caution</h4><p>The API is still experimental and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceObserver" target="_blank" rel="external">in “Editor’s Draft” state</a>. Also, the fact that a browser supports PerformanceObserver doesn’t mean that it supports the Paint events.</p><p>In the quick test I run, the above snippet would throw an exception:</p><figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">Uncaught TypeError: Failed to execute ‘observe’ on</div><div class="line">‘PerformanceObserver’: A Performance Observer MUST</div><div class="line">have at least one valid entryType in its entryTypes</div><div class="line">attribute.</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>It turns out that if you only observe the <code>paint</code> entryType and this is not supported in the browser, <strong>it will throw an exception</strong>. According to <a href="https://w3c.github.io/performance-timeline/#dom-performanceobserverinit-entrytypes" target="_blank" rel="external">the specification</a>:</p><blockquote><p><code>entryTypes</code>: A list of entry names to be observed. The list must not be empty and types not recognized by the user agent must be ignored.</p></blockquote><p>In short, if you are giving this API a try, make sure you <code>try...catch</code> the <code>observer.observe()</code> call.</p><h4 id="Conclusions"><a href="#Conclusions" class="headerlink" title="Conclusions"></a>Conclusions</h4><p>This is a bit in early stages but I’m looking forward to see how the API evolves and we can use it to track Web Performance even better. This will also be a great addition to <a href="https://developes.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/" target="_blank" rel="external">LightHouse</a>, <a href="http://www.webpagetest.org" target="_blank" rel="external">WebPageTest</a>, <a href="https://calibreapp.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Calibre</a> and the rest of tools we use to monitor metrics on our sites.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just attended <a href="http://2017.jsday.es" target="_blank" rel="external">JSDayES 2017</a> in Madrid, where I gave my talk about images and web performance.

There is a lot going on in Madrid and the rest of Spain, with very interesting companies building awesome products.</p><a id="more"></a><p>There were 500+ attendees and the event had 3 tracks with 26 talks, shorter and longer ones, and workshops. It was difficult to attend the talks and workshops I wanted to, not only because of time constraints but also space. I’m looking forward to watching some of the talks on video when they upload the recordings, and update this post with the ones I find most interesting.</p><p>The event showcased the local talent, with a track dedicated to “rising stars” for speakers with less experience, which I think was a great idea. There was an international one with English-speaking talks, and finally the main track with some talks in English, some others in Spanish.</p><p><a href="/assets/images/posts/jsdayes-2017-pinchito-substack.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/posts/jsdayes-2017-pinchito-substack.jpg" alt="The Render Conf 2017 sign by the entrance of King&#39;s Centre"></a> ^ <em>Alex (<a href="https://twitter.com/pinchito" target="_blank" rel="external">@pinchito</a>) introducing James Halliday’s (<a href="https://twitter.com/substack" target="_blank" rel="external">@substack</a>) talk.</em></p><p>This is the third edition of the event, which is consolidating as the main Javascript conference in Spain.</p><p>Being a Spaniard myself it was fine, but I would like to see even more talks in English, making the event more internationally renowned. This would not only help the event, but also the speakers which could have a higher impact by making their talks more accessible to the rest of the world.</p><p><a href="/assets/images/posts/jsdayes-2017-sign.jpg"><img src="/assets/images/posts/jsdayes-2017-sign.jpg" alt="The JSDayES 2017 sign by the entrance of the venue"></a></p><h2 id="My-talk-about-“Progressive-Image-Rendering”"><a href="#My-talk-about-“Progressive-Image-Rendering”" class="headerlink" title="My talk about “Progressive Image Rendering”"></a>My talk about “Progressive Image Rendering”</h2><div class="videoWrapper"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/220960739?byline=0&portrait=0" width="684" height="385" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>This talk is similar to the one I gave at <a href="/cssconf-au-2016">CSSConf AU</a> and <a href="/render-conf-oxford-2017">RenderConf Oxford</a>.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Spotify <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/news-stories/2017/04/10/new-endpoints-beta-web-api-connect/" target="_blank" rel="external">released recently a set of endpoints</a> in beta to fetch information of what is playing and send playback commands. This allows for a wide range of integrations and I wanted to hack a bit with it.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/posts/spotify-connect.jpg" alt="Spotify Connect"></p><a id="more"></a><h4 id="What-is-Spotify-Connect"><a href="#What-is-Spotify-Connect" class="headerlink" title="What is Spotify Connect"></a>What is Spotify Connect</h4><p><a href="https://www.spotify.com/connect/" target="_blank" rel="external">Spotify Connect</a> is a way to transmit the playback from one device to another one without having to use a physical connection like a cable or bluetooth. You can send the music from your Spotify desktop client to a speaker, from the Spotify app on mobile to Spotify for PlayStation, from the Spotify web player to Chromecast… In short, you have controllers and devices that can play music.</p><p><img src="/assets/images/posts/spotify-web-player.png" alt="Spotify Web Player"> <small class="caption">Spotify’s Web Player (zoomed in). Clicking on the icon next to the volume we get a list of connected devices (FireTV, desktop client, speakers and the web player).</small></p><p>Your application can become a controller through the Web API endpoints, getting information about what is playing currently and from where, being able to transmit the playback to another connected device or interact with the current context (pausing, changing the volume, skipping, playing something else…).</p><h4 id="How-to-use-the-endpoints"><a href="#How-to-use-the-endpoints" class="headerlink" title="How to use the endpoints"></a>How to use the endpoints</h4><p>Before using the Connect endpoints we need to obtain an access token on behalf of the user with certain permissions. There is more information about what scopes are needed in the documentation for each endpoint.</p><p>You don’t need to have a premium account to get the playback status, a free account is alright. You will do need a premium one if you want to <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/working-with-connect/#premium-only" target="_blank" rel="external">send commands to change the playback</a>.</p><p>A caveat at the moment is that the endpoints don’t support any kind of web socket connection nor long polling.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="/medium-image-progressive-loading-placeholder">a past post</a> I dissected a technique used by Medium to display images, transitioning from a blurry image to the final one. Since then I have found some more sites following a similar approach. Let’s see how Quora, Quartz and Clicktorelease do it.</p><a id="more"></a><h2 id="Quick-Introduction"><a href="#Quick-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Quick Introduction"></a>Quick Introduction</h2><p>Images are the largest assets on web pages and they account for two thirds of the bytes. Image optimisation and choosing the right image format is paramount. In addition, some sites are also using small thumbnails as placeholders while the final image hasn’t loaded yet. This technique is also called <em>“<a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-blur-up-technique-for-loading-background-images/" target="_blank" rel="external">blur-up</a>“</em>. It basically tries to improve user’s perceived performance while also saving data traffic when combined with lazy-loading.</p><p>There are other alternatives to this approach. One of them consists of using a single JPEG image, tweaking its scan script to quickly render an initial pixelated version of the image and progressively load the final image in several scans. I recommend you having a look at <a href="http://cloudinary.com/blog/progressive_jpegs_and_green_martians" target="_blank" rel="external">Progressive JPEGs and green Martians</a> to know more about this.</p><p>Also, if you like images optimisation, follow <a href="http://cloudinary.com/blog" target="_blank" rel="external">Cloudinary’s Blog</a>, full with useful posts on this topic.</p><h3 id="Quartz"><a href="#Quartz" class="headerlink" title="Quartz"></a>Quartz</h3><p>Take a look at the following video, recorded when accessing <a href="https://qz.com/894001/theres-a-wrong-and-a-right-way-to-talk-to-your-dog-according-to-science/" target="_blank" rel="external">a page on QZ.com</a> with a throttled connection:</p><figure class="videoWrapper"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cbz3V4FGCE4" allowfullscreen width="720" height="393" frameborder="0"></iframe></figure><p>Quartz’s implementation follows this steps:</p><ol><li>Request a small <code>&lt;img/&gt;</code> that will be blurred. In their case, they use 50px width images, with a 80% quality.</li><li>Apply blur effect using a CSS filter.</li><li>Request the large image.</li></ol><p>One of the interesting points about Quartz is that their markup specifies the large image using the syntax for responsive images. The main difference is that they use a <code>data-srcset</code> attribute, so they control when to make the request and prevent the browser from requesting the large version of the image when the markup is parsed.</p><p>I find this approach very neat since they try to follow the “standard” way to serve images, adding extra bits to lazy load and animate the transition.</p><figure class="highlight html"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><div class="line"><span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">figure</span> <span class="attr">class</span>=<span class="string">"progressive-image featured-image size-extra-large"</span>&gt;</span></div><div class="line">  <span class="comment">&lt;!-- a picture element with intrinsic ratio --&gt;</span></div><div class="line">  <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">picture</span> <span class="attr">style</span>=<span class="string">"padding-bottom: 56.1875%; background-image: url(https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/fish.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=50);"</span>&gt;</span></div><div class="line">    <span class="comment">&lt;!-- the small image that will be blurred --&gt;</span></div><div class="line">    <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">img</span> <span class="attr">src</span>=<span class="string">"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/fish.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=50"</span> <span class="attr">class</span>=<span class="string">"progressive-image-thumbnail"</span>&gt;</span></div><div class="line">    <span class="comment">&lt;!-- a lazy responsive image with data-srcset --&gt;</span></div><div class="line">    <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">img</span></span></div><div class="line">      <span class="attr">itemprop</span>=<span class="string">"image"</span></div><div class="line">      <span class="attr">data-srcset</span>=<span class="string">"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/fish.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=320 320w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/fish.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=640 640w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/fish.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=940 940w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/fish.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/fish.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=3200 3200w"</span></div><div class="line">      <span class="attr">data-src</span>=<span class="string">"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/fish.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=320"</span></div><div class="line">      <span class="attr">class</span>=<span class="string">"progressive-image-large"</span> <span class="attr">alt</span>=<span class="string">"INDIA-fishermen"</span>/&gt;</div><div class="line">    <span class="comment">&lt;!-- a noscript fallback --&gt;</span></div><div class="line">    <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">noscript</span>&gt;</span></div><div class="line">      <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">img</span></span></div><div class="line">        <span class="attr">src</span>=<span class="string">"https://qzprod.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/fish.jpg?quality=80&amp;strip=all&amp;w=320"</span></div><div class="line">        <span class="attr">alt</span>=<span class="string">"INDIA-fishermen"</span>&gt;</div><div class="line">    <span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">noscript</span>&gt;</span></div><div class="line">  <span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">picture</span>&gt;</span></div><div class="line">  <span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">figcaption</span>&gt;</span>...<span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">figcaption</span>&gt;</span></div><div class="line"><span class="tag">&lt;/<span class="name">figure</span>&gt;</span></div></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h3 id="Quora"><a href="#Quora" class="headerlink" title="Quora"></a>Quora</h3><p>Quora also implements a blur-up technique for the images in their posts.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I usually see myself spending more time migrating from one setup to another one than writing valuable content. After all, I consider my blog a playground where I try some concepts.</p><p>It is still <a href="http://jlongster.com/Presenting-The-Most-Over-Engineered-Blog-Ever" target="_blank" rel="external">not very over-engineered</a> and <a href="https://github.com/JMPerez/jmperez.github.com" target="_blank" rel="external">being open sourced and available on GitHub</a> I thought someone could benefit from it.</p><a id="more"></a><h2 id="Static-Site"><a href="#Static-Site" class="headerlink" title="Static Site"></a>Static Site</h2><p>The blog is a set of static pages. Before that it used to be a Wordpress site and eventually <a href="/migrating-wordpress-jekyll-github-pages">I migrated to Jekyll and GitHub Pages</a>. This worked really well because I could take advantage of GitHub’s distributed storage to serve the assets, and there is nothing that can beat a static site in terms of performance, which I care about.</p><p>In October 2016 I migrated to <a href="https://hexo.io/" target="_blank" rel="external">Hexo</a>. Hexo is fast, and the posts are written in the same Markdown format I like and I used with Jekyll, so moving to Hexo was really easy.</p><p>Migrating to Hexo was a bit of a trade-off. Now I need to generate the static site from my computer and then deploy the files, instead of just using the GitHub editor, which was handy to fix small typos. The advantage is that I can create plugins in Javascript (and understand and tweak existing ones) to customise the output, which is better overall.</p><h2 id="Progressive-Images"><a href="#Progressive-Images" class="headerlink" title="Progressive Images"></a>Progressive Images</h2><p>The few JPG images on this site are progressive JPGs, <a href="/ssim-jpeg-io">generated using Jpeg.io</a>. Having a more custom technique to load images, like <a href="/medium-image-progressive-loading-placeholder">Medium’s approach</a>, is overkill. Progressive JPGs start rendering soon, and as the browser downloads more of the file it shows a better version of the image. You can see an example on <a href="https://www.webpagetest.org/result/170207_N3_1794c7ee69d5a1a3eb92842504f01a7b/" target="_blank" rel="external">this WebPageTest run</a>.</p><p><a href="/assets/images/posts/jmperez-filmstrip.png"><img src="/assets/images/posts/jmperez-filmstrip.png" alt="Filmstrip for jmperezperez.com"></a></p><p>Something in my to-do list is to prevent <a href="https://css-tricks.com/content-jumping-avoid/" target="_blank" rel="external">content jumping</a> by using some <a href="http://blog.learningspaces.io/flexible-cover-images-using-intrinsic-ratio/" target="_blank" rel="external">intrinsic ratio placeholders</a> for the images, and lazy-load them.</p><h2 id="SSL-and-HTTP-2"><a href="#SSL-and-HTTP-2" class="headerlink" title="SSL and HTTP/2"></a>SSL and HTTP/2</h2><p>This site is served on HTTPS. I already talked about <a href="/github-pages-ssl-custom-domain">how and why I migrated to SSL</a>. A good thing about using Cloudflare for SSL is that I also get HTTP/2 support, so I can start investigating it a bit more. I would like to give Server Push a try though, but for that I would need to run my own server. Maybe some time in the future.</p><p>Finally, Cloudflare also allows me to set the browser cache expiration, increasing the short one that GitHub Pages set by default.</p><h2 id="Accelerated-Mobile-Pages-aka-AMP"><a href="#Accelerated-Mobile-Pages-aka-AMP" class="headerlink" title="Accelerated Mobile Pages (aka AMP)"></a>Accelerated Mobile Pages (aka AMP)</h2><p>I’m not a big fan of <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">Google’s AMP</a>, <a href="https://instantarticles.fb.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Facebook’s Instant Articles</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news-publisher/" target="_blank" rel="external">Apple News</a>. I think developers can create experiences on the web with a good performance without having to resort to a subset of the language nor a specific markup for a proprietary crawler.</p><p>Still, I wanted to give AMP a try, so I now generate an AMP version of every post on build time. Does it have any impact in traffic? Well, not much yet. Only around 2% of the page views to this site are for AMP’d pages.</p><h2 id="Service-Worker-and-Offline-content"><a href="#Service-Worker-and-Offline-content" class="headerlink" title="Service Worker and Offline content"></a>Service Worker and Offline content</h2><p>The last addition to the site is a Service Worker which caches the main sections of this blog (home, projects, about) plus an offline page linking to those three. Additionally, if you visit a page it will be available when offline. I think it is a good trade-off.</p><p><a href="/sw.js">The implementation</a> is based on <a href="https://serviceworke.rs/strategy-cache-and-update_service-worker_doc.html" target="_blank" rel="external">the cache and update strategy</a> with a small variation. In my case I check the network, then the cache, and finally serve the <code>offline</code> page if no hit.</p><p>If you are thinking of making your site available when offline, be a good citizen. I have seen Service Workers that download all the posts from a blog. To be honest, this doesn’t do any good for your users. By doing so you might be killing their data plan or using precious space in their devices. If you still want to preload/prefetch/download content, do it wisely.</p><p>When browsing the App Store/Play Store, the user has an indication of the size of the app, so they might choose not to download it when they are using roaming or tethering. On the web we don’t have something like this.</p><h2 id="Performance"><a href="#Performance" class="headerlink" title="Performance"></a>Performance</h2><p>I like talking about web performance so my own site has to be a good example of what I advocate for. I use <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjmperezperez.com" target="_blank" rel="external">PageSpeed Insights</a> to check the performance and usability on mobile (score &gt;=99/100 for most pages) and <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/" target="_blank" rel="external">Lighthouse</a> (100/100).</p><p><a href="/assets/images/posts/jmperezperez-lighthouse.png"><img src="/assets/images/posts/jmperezperez-lighthouse.png" alt="Screenshot from Lighthouse for jmperezperez.com"></a></p><p>I’m looking forward to more ideas that I can apply to this blog and then some real project at scale :)</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Try this library, it’s the best thing ever. Try this technique, it will make your site automatically faster. I read and hear people praising libraries or technologies very often. It can come as a blog post, talk at a conference or informal conversation. It is fine to talk about the benefits of using A over B, but be alert if A doesn’t seem to have any drawbacks.</p><a id="more"></a><p><img src="/assets/images/posts/tools.jpg" alt="A picture of some tools"></p><p>I have done it myself. Most devs (at least web ones) are excited about the progress in network protocols, browser APIs and libraries amongst others. Gone are the days of building web sites for Netscape and &lt;IE6 with FrontPage, debugging with alerts, requesting many unminified files. I don’t want to go back to those days, and I hope you do not either.</p><p>It might be that I’m getting old, grumpy and boring. Or “experienced” might be the word. I even think it might have to do with web fatigue (à la JS).</p><p>HTTP/2, React, AMP, BEM… every new thing seems to fix the pains of our web sites. <strong>And we don’t do ourselves a favour when we jump on the bandwagon and amplify their benefits, without even trying them out</strong>. Without being capable of understanding the effects of embracing them. The negative effects.</p><p>We shouldn’t become sales people, but engineers with a toolset, aware of the limitations and trade-offs of each of them. <strong>No single tool is the best one for every project</strong>.</p><p>The contrary also happens many times. People will also criticise without having enough information, only because the general consensus is to be against it (eg using jQuery or Angular). Sometimes it looks like it’s a “with me or against me” situation.</p><h2 id="Trade-offs-and-nuances"><a href="#Trade-offs-and-nuances" class="headerlink" title="Trade-offs and nuances"></a>Trade-offs and nuances</h2><p>I appreciate it when people talk honestly about technology and don’t get driven by the idea that the new thing is always better. Sure, it has been created for a reason, probably to fill a gap or improve a specific aspect, but it will likely come with some problems.</p><p>Everything is fine when you are implementing <em>Hello World</em> (should I say also a <em>Todo app</em>)? However, it might not work for another project, like the one you are involved right now at your company. Those need to be stable, scalable, testable and maintainable.</p><h2 id="Talking-publicly-about-new-tech-conferences-and-blog-posts"><a href="#Talking-publicly-about-new-tech-conferences-and-blog-posts" class="headerlink" title="Talking publicly about new tech - conferences and blog posts"></a>Talking publicly about new tech - conferences and blog posts</h2><p>I find it quite valuable when someone talks about using a certain technology applied to a real project. They are usually stories about illusions, obstacles, work-arounds, trade-offs. Those are close to real life experiences than what most sources will claim.</p><p>Before recommending a solution, make sure you know about its drawbacks. Don’t limit yourself to describe its benefits. <strong>Tell how you tried to apply it, what issues you found and how you managed to solve or mitigate them</strong>.</p><p>I like watching recorded talks from web conferences. I think that the best talks are those about real projects where something went wrong. Basically, any real project. Even better when the speaker works at a medium-size company, where projects are big large enough to have representative issues, and the company is small enough so the speaker can give details openly.</p><p>If you need some examples, check out these talks:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WIDa5-bPDs" target="_blank" rel="external">Michael Mifsud’s “Real World HTTP/2”</a> on the effects of applying HTTP/2 to 99designs’s web site.</li><li>Vitaly Friedman’s “How We Moved To HTTP/2 To Improve Performance… And Failed” on how <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Smashing Magazine</a> was moved to HTTP/2 and had issues with web fonts and ads.

But more importantly, their failure modes are well understood — Dan McKinley on <a href="http://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology" target="_blank" rel="external">Choose Boring Technology</a>.</p></blockquote><p>The fact that it is used by a large company definitely helps getting some backing. Still, that company might have resolved issues with tooling that won’t necessarily share publicly.</p><p><strong>What will be the technical problems if I use it for my project?</strong></p><p>Performance issues? Increase in build time? Dependencies you don’t control? Sooner than later you will need to dig into the internals of the technology to understand what is going on.</p><p><strong>Will it be embraced/enforced in my project?</strong></p><p>For this, other members in the project need to be knowledgeable so they can maintain it and apply it to new areas of the project. Otherwise it will become something you introduced that nobody feels comfortable with. That is why it is important to get buy-in from your colleagues, document the solutions and use tools like linters and checkers to enforce these solutions.</p><h2 id="Apply-it-to-a-small-project"><a href="#Apply-it-to-a-small-project" class="headerlink" title="Apply it to a small project"></a>Apply it to a small project</h2><p>I’m not saying you shouldn’t try out that new shiny thing.</p><p>Let’s say React seems to solve some problems you are facing in a project, or at least that’s what you think after seeing all the hype about Facebook’s library. Try building first a side project with it, or a prototype that resembles the project you are working on. Don’t skip aspects like expressiveness, debuggability, performance, testability and scalability. Sure, it’s going to be very difficult to know about these unless you make the project larger, or do some research.</p><p>If you can’t spend your free time on a side project, ask for some time to work on a prototype. It will help if you time-box it, so your colleagues and stakeholders can expect some conclusions on a given date. Some companies also arrange hack days, hackathons or something like Google’s 20% that you can use to experiment.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Let’s try to get more informed about how every tool fits in our projects, their limitations and how to choose the most suitable one given a set of constraints. Our approach should be analytical, and not get driven by the novelty or the feeling of a few people.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At <a href="/cssconf-au-2016/">CSSConf AU 2016</a>, <a href="https://soledadpenades.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Soledad Penadés</a> gave a talk called “<a href="https://soledadpenades.com/files/t/2016_rtalchemy/" target="_blank" rel="external">Real time front-end alchemy</a>“. It was full of examples of combining <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Media_Streams_API" target="_blank" rel="external">MediaStreams</a> with audio and video manipulation.</p><p>Something I didn’t know was that you can record audio and video on the browser without any plugins. You can combine audio from the microphone, video from a canvas, dynamically generated content… you name it. Even recording a window or the entire screen and exporting it as a video.</p><a id="more"></a><p>The best way to learn is by practising and, <a href="https://soledadpenades.com/files/t/2016_rtalchemy/#65" target="_blank" rel="external">quoting Soledad</a>, “we need you to play with it, contribute and help us make it better”. By trying these new APIs out we let browser-vendors know that these tools are useful, and we can test and provide early feedback.</p><h2 id="The-project"><a href="#The-project" class="headerlink" title="The project"></a>The project</h2><div class="videoWrapper"><iframe width="720" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tOWwV8ZRn3g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>I had this idea about creating a <a href="http://www.telestream.net/screenflow/overview.htm" target="_blank" rel="external">ScreenFlow</a>-like prototype. I would show my webcam in a corner of the screen and I would generate a video combining audio from the mic and the image from the screen.</p><p>I Googled a bit, and found very few sites talking about these APIs. Pretty much only <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStream_Recording_API" target="_blank" rel="external">MDN</a> and <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2016/04/record-almost-everything-in-the-browser-with-mediarecorder/" target="_blank" rel="external">other post by Sole</a>. I thought this small experiment would also help those searching for some examples.</p><p><em>Note: As of December 2016 this demo is only supported on Firefox. Chrome is not supported out of the box, needing an extension and lots of custom code (see this WebRTC experiment for more information. It will show your camera, but won’t record anything.</em></p><h3 id="The-code"><a href="#The-code" class="headerlink" title="The code"></a>The code</h3><p>The code for the project is at <a href="https://github.com/JMPerez/screenflow" target="_blank" rel="external">JMPerez/screenflow on GitHub</a> and a demo is available on <a href="https://jmperezperez.com/screenflow/">jmperezperez.com/screenflow</a>.</p><p>Let’s have a look at the most important code fragments. First of all, we define functions to request access to the different media sources:</p><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><div class="line"><span class="comment">// we ask for permission to record the window</span></div><div class="line"><span class="comment">// mediaSource could also be 'screen' if we wanted</span></div><div class="line"><span class="comment">// to record the entire screen</span></div><div class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> getStreamForWindow = <span class="function"><span class="params">()</span> =&gt;</span> navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia(&#123;</div><div class="line">  <span class="attr">video</span>: &#123;</div><div class="line">    <span class="attr">mediaSource</span>: <span class="string">'window'</span></div><div class="line">  &#125;</div><div class="line">&#125;);</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line"><span class="comment">// we ask for permission to record the audio and video from the camera</span></div><div class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> getStreamForCamera = <span class="function"><span class="params">()</span> =&gt;</span> navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia(&#123;</div><div class="line">   <span class="attr">audio</span>: <span class="literal">true</span></div><div class="line">&#125;);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Now, we execute them, one after the other one. I tried to execute both in parallel, believing that the browser would combine both requests in the permission dialog, but that didn’t work. So the idea is to request access to the webcam, insert a <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element with the media from the camera and then request access to the screen and record it.</p><figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">getStreamForCamera().then(<span class="function"><span class="params">streamCamera</span> =&gt;</span> &#123;</div><div class="line">    <span class="comment">// we know have access to the camera, let's append it to the DOM</span></div><div class="line">    appendCamera(streamCamera);</div><div class="line">    getStreamForWindow().then(<span class="function"><span class="params">streamWindow</span> =&gt;</span> &#123;</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">      <span class="comment">// we now have access to the screen too</span></div><div class="line">      <span class="comment">// we generate a combined stream with the video from the</span></div><div class="line">      <span class="comment">// screen and the audio from the camera</span></div><div class="line">      <span class="keyword">var</span> finalStream = <span class="keyword">new</span> MediaStream();</div><div class="line">      <span class="keyword">const</span> videoTrack = streamWindow.getVideoTracks()[<span class="number">0</span>];</div><div class="line">      finalStream.addTrack(videoTrack);</div><div class="line">      <span class="keyword">const</span> audioTrack = streamCamera.getAudioTracks()[<span class="number">0</span>];</div><div class="line">      finalStream.addTrack(audioTrack);</div><div class="line">      <span class="keyword">this</span>.recorder = <span class="keyword">new</span> MediaRecorder(finalStream);</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">      <span class="comment">// we subscribe to 'ondataavailable'.</span></div><div class="line">      <span class="comment">// this gets called when the recording is stopped.</span></div><div class="line">      <span class="keyword">this</span>.recorder.ondataavailable = <span class="function"><span class="keyword">function</span>(<span class="params">e</span>) </span>&#123;</div><div class="line">        <span class="comment">// let's create a blob with e.data which has the</span></div><div class="line">        <span class="comment">// contents of the video in webm</span></div><div class="line">        <span class="keyword">var</span> link = <span class="built_in">document</span>.createElement(<span class="string">'a'</span>);</div><div class="line">        link.setAttribute(<span class="string">'href'</span>, <span class="built_in">window</span>.URL.createObjectURL(e.data));</div><div class="line">        link.setAttribute(<span class="string">'download'</span>, <span class="string">'video_'</span> + <span class="built_in">Math</span>.floor((<span class="built_in">Math</span>.random() * <span class="number">999999</span>)) + <span class="string">'.webm'</span>);</div><div class="line">        link.style.display = <span class="string">'none'</span>;</div><div class="line">        <span class="built_in">document</span>.body.appendChild(link);</div><div class="line">        link.click();</div><div class="line">        <span class="built_in">document</span>.body.removeChild(link);</div><div class="line">      &#125;</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">      <span class="comment">// start recording</span></div><div class="line">      <span class="keyword">this</span>.recorder.start();</div><div class="line">    &#125;);</div><div class="line">  &#125;);</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Now, we finally need to call <code>this.recorder.stop()</code> whenever we want to stop the recording, which will make the browser save the file automatically. In my example, I’m attaching a key event listener for the “escape” key.</p><h3 id="A-note-about-permissions"><a href="#A-note-about-permissions" class="headerlink" title="A note about permissions"></a>A note about permissions</h3><p>In order to make this work you will need to whitelist the domain trying to record your screen. On Firefox, <code>localhost</code> will work out of the box. If you want to publish the code somewhere else, like GitHub Pages, make sure you whitelist it.</p><p>On Firefox, navigate to <code>about:config</code> and look for the key <code>media.getusermedia.screensharing.allowed_domains</code>. Add your domain to the list and restart the browser. Then, when you are running the code, the user will be able to grant access for both the webcam and the screen.</p><p>It is unclear whether this will be how a user lets a site record their screen, but it is how this works at the moment.</p><h3 id="A-step-further-making-this-embeddable"><a href="#A-step-further-making-this-embeddable" class="headerlink" title="A step further, making this embeddable"></a>A step further, making this embeddable</h3><p>The example code worked fine, but I wanted to take it a bit further. What if I wanted to use this “recording” functionality in more than one project? Also, given that the user has to whitelist a domain, we could serve the code from an <code>iframe</code> on that domain, so we wouldn’t need to add more domains to the <code>about:config</code>.</p><p>The final version of the prototype is based now on a script that you include on a page. The script appends an <code>iframe</code>, which executes the code we saw above and shows the output from the webcam at full size. Apart from the <code>iframe</code>, it also binds several key event listeners to toggle the visibility and size of the <code>iframe</code>.</p><p>These are the keys you can press to perform some actions:</p><ul><li>Escape: finishes the recording and saves the file</li><li>s: Switches the camera between full page and picture-in-picture</li><li>a: Toggles the visibility of the camera</li></ul><p>You can then include the script to any page to get this screen recording functionality. For instance, we can include <code>https://jmperezperez.com/screenflow/lib/embed.js</code> on a codepen and record a screencast.</p><h3 id="Limitations"><a href="#Limitations" class="headerlink" title="Limitations"></a>Limitations</h3><p>Keep in mind this is only a proof of concept and doesn’t have any real utility. If you are serious about recording a screencast, don’t use this hack :)</p><p>There are, of course, some limitations:</p><ul><li>The iframe with the camera is shown on top of the hosting page, but it will be hidden if we put some other window on top.</li><li>If we navigate from the hosting page to somewhere else we will lose the recording. This can be workaround by having, in the hosting page, an iframe for the camera and another iframe for the page we are recording, in full screen</li><li>If we click on the iframe with the camera, the key events will stop working because the hosting page doesn’t receive those. This can be solved sending <code>postMessage</code>s from the iframe to the hosting page.</li></ul>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just attended <a href="http://2016.cssconf.com.au" target="_blank" rel="external">CSSConf Australia in Melbourne</a>, where I gave a talk about images and web performance. It was a blast! Very well organised and with a great atmosphere. In this post I give a short introduction about the event and I include links to the slides, videos and the script. <img src="/assets/images/posts/cssconf-au-2016-sign.jpg" alt="The CSSConf AU 2016 sign at the entrance"></p><a id="more"></a><h2 id="Call-for-Papers-and-Organization"><a href="#Call-for-Papers-and-Organization" class="headerlink" title="Call for Papers and Organization"></a>Call for Papers and Organization</h2><p>Back in August I sent a proposal for <a href="http://2016.cssconf.com.au/call-for-speakers/" target="_blank" rel="external">CSSConf AU 2016’s Call For Papers</a> and I got accepted. Just by reading their CFP it was clear this event was very well organised. I liked that the projects and companies mentioned in the CFP had to be renamed to PROJECT_A, COMPANY_A, etc to make the selection process more fair. It’s also refreshing seeing speakers with very different background, and I love how the organisation has made diversity and inclusion the pillars of the triplet CSSConf / JSConf / Decompress. Details like the variety of food and live captioning show that they are serious about it.</p><p>As a speaker, they have been very supportive providing all the information about the event way ahead of time, and offering help with the design of the slides and preparation. And once in Melbourne they also prepared a nice welcome pack, including a SIM card that has been great for me to be in contact with my family during these days.</p><p>When they say it’s taken them 9 months to prepare the conference I don’t question it. One can see they had covered every little detail.</p><p>I recommend to check <a href="http://brett.cool/photoessays/2016/cssconfau/" target="_blank" rel="external">Brett Jones’ write-up about the event</a>, that is full with great pictures and descriptions about the talks.</p><p>Personally, it’s the first time I travel so far from home, and I have also accomplished a personal dream of speaking at a top-level large conference.</p><h2 id="My-talk-about-“Progressive-Image-Rendering”"><a href="#My-talk-about-“Progressive-Image-Rendering”" class="headerlink" title="My talk about “Progressive Image Rendering”"></a>My talk about “Progressive Image Rendering”</h2><p>The talk I gave is based on some posts I have been writing during last 1.5 years. It’s a combination of insights while redesigning (and rewriting) <a href="https://open.spotify.com" target="_blank" rel="external">open.spotify.com</a>, plus some smaller projects I had been working on, also related with images.</p><p>A month before the talk, the folks at <a href="https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/Stockholm-Web-Performance-Group/events/234796510/" target="_blank" rel="external">Stockholm Web Performance Group</a> gave me a slot in one of their Meetups to present it, which was really useful to get feedback.

Of course I failed to stick to 100%.</p><hr><h4 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h4><p>As users we like applications and websites to load fast, or at least feel like the load fast. As developers we struggle finding the best way to optimize and serve the assets needed for our projects in the best way.</p><p>We tend to talk a lot about the size of CSS and JS. We love discussing about this or that library, on saving some bytes at the cost of functionality. React vs preact?</p><p>It is very easy to forget about images. Images still represent roughly two thirds of the size of a web page, and the trend is pretty stable, increasing over time. Let’s not forget about the main culprit.</p><p>In this presentation I want to discuss about images, making the case for using them and only then find the best way to serve them. I will talk about different ways to load images that some sites and applications use in real life. They try to improve the user’s perceived performance using placeholders, blurry thumbnails and dominant colours.</p><p>Some of them are not as standard as we would like them to be, but they are there to fill a gap.</p><p>Like most developers, I try to get up to date with the latest techniques to build fast and pretty websites. I try many things, but only a few end up working. Some of those techniques are good in theory, but don’t cover our use case completely.</p><p>I will show some examples of pages I have implemented or seen out there, and the issues found addressing image performance.</p><h4 id="The-case-for-using-images"><a href="#The-case-for-using-images" class="headerlink" title="The case for using images"></a>The case for using images</h4><p>We’ve been using images on the web for a long time. Not only to show nice pictures, but also for rounded corners and gradients before CSS finished with these hacks. But it would be silly to try to improve the perceived performance of images that are not optimized, or are not even needed.</p><p>With the trend of flat and minimalist design we have reduced the need of images on the web. Fewer images also means less problems to make our site look good on multiple devices without sending too many bytes down the wire. And reducing images, especially bitmap ones, prevents us from generating several sizes and keeping an “original” image for future modifications (think of PSD files).</p><p>The fact of reducing the need of images also means that there is more bandwidth to load other resources. This is especially important in slow networks.</p><p>Some images might look great on desktop but provide little value on mobile. Maybe we don’t even need to load that image in certain viewports. Setting the display property to “none” will hide the image, but won’t prevent the browser from requesting it. A better alternative is to set a background-image using CSS. Similarly, hiding sections in your markup that contain images won’t prevent the request. A better approach is to use a template engine that only adds to the markup the needed section. These days lots of people use a component-based library that will take care of this.</p><h4 id="Optimising-images"><a href="#Optimising-images" class="headerlink" title="Optimising images"></a>Optimising images</h4><p><em>More info on <a href="/ssim-jpeg-io">JPG compression level, SSIM and Jpeg.io</a></em></p><p>I can’t find a reason why not to optimize images. We have had good tools like jpegoptim and imageoptim for a long time. They will output the same image with fewer bytes. For formats like JPEG it is difficult for us to choose what compression level we should use. 80? 90? It really depends on the source image. There are tools that will find the best compression level to generate an image that is visually identical to a given one.</p><p>Performance is a difficult topic. A heavier page might be perceived as faster. Think of a page that inlines its critical CSS and lazy loads the full stylesheet. Overall, it is sending more bytes, but it will be perceived as faster.</p><h4 id="Picture-element-and-srcset-sizes"><a href="#Picture-element-and-srcset-sizes" class="headerlink" title="Picture element and srcset/sizes"></a>Picture element and srcset/sizes</h4><p>We have seen examples where we could avoid requesting an image and have gone through optimizations that we can apply to an image. For large images we have a valuable HTML element and img’s attributes we can use. We can finally use responsive images in all modern browsers. You define what images you want to serve depending on some media queries.</p><p>In theory it is a good approach, in practice I see two things that are far from ideal.</p><p>Firstly, the browser knows the dimensions of the window, but needs extra information to pick the right image to download. This is so it can request the images without having to wait until the CSS is downloaded and parsed. The markup can get quite verbose, and these values depend on the visual design, which CSS is supposed to dictate. In the end you end up with duplication, and it is not easy to defined those media queries once and import them both in CSS and HTML.</p><p>Secondly, the lack of a standard lazy-loading solution. Most users don’t scroll through the whole page, and it makes sense to delay the request of images below the fold until they are needed. The most performant request is the one that is never made. You want to use <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> for all images, since it’s the most sensible and standard thing to do. But the browser sees them and requests all of them even if they are far from the visible area. I wish there was a way for browsers to do this in a standard way.</p><p>A middle ground is to use responsive images for above the fold content, and lazy load the rest. This is in fact what we do in Spotify for pages like albums, where we display the cover art above the fold, and then we show a section with more albums by that artist, in which we lazy load the images.</p><h4 id="How-to-lazy-load"><a href="#How-to-lazy-load" class="headerlink" title="How to lazy load"></a>How to lazy load</h4><p><em>More info on <a href="/lazy-loading-images">How to lazy-load images to improve loading time and save bandwidth</a></em></p><p>When doing lazy load, we want to detect when the page is scrolled or resized, and then check whether the placeholder for our image is within the rendered section of the page. And this needs to be performed for all the images we want to lazy load.</p><p>Scroll listeners can have a negative impact in scrolling performance. During the scroll movement, the browser triggers many scroll events, and finding out the position and dimension of our images causes a layout recalculation. This is an expensive operation that makes the browser spend too long drawing frames, producing stuttering when scrolling. So what should be an improvement might spoil the perceived performance.</p><p>There is an experimental API called IntersectionObserver that suits very well this use case. Instead of subscribing to the scroll event, and then go through the lazy-loaded images, IntersectionObserver allows us to subscribe to an event that is triggered when the image enters the rendered area (viewport).</p><p>It is supported in Chrome and Opera, and in development in Firefox and Edge.</p><h4 id="What-to-show-while-the-image-is-loading"><a href="#What-to-show-while-the-image-is-loading" class="headerlink" title="What to show while the image is loading"></a>What to show while the image is loading</h4><p>An interesting topic in loading images is what to show until the image is downloaded. And this is even more important when doing lazy loading.</p><p>When the image is loading we can do several things. The easiest one is not to do anything. We reserve some area in which the image will be eventually loaded. Another possibility is showing a placeholder. If you do this, try to use inlined SVG so they are served quicker.</p><p>Then we have the more interesting options. One could fill the area where an image is going to be loaded with a solid colour. The colour will be obtained from the image. It can be the dominant colour, the more vivid colour… There are libraries to extract these colours as a palette. A drawback is that you need some pre-processing of your images to calculate these colours.</p><p>One last option is to use a small version of the image, like a thumbnail, scale it and apply a blur effect. For this one you need to generate that smaller image, so it is the option that increases the size of the overall page the most.</p><p>Solid colour and blurry images are the ones that are used to improve user’s perceived performance. We will see how real sites put them in practice.</p><h4 id="Examples-of-solid-colour"><a href="#Examples-of-solid-colour" class="headerlink" title="Examples of solid colour"></a>Examples of solid colour</h4><p>First of all, let’s see examples of using a solid colour as the background.</p><p>Google added recently an option to Google Chrome, especially targeted to slow connections. In those cases it doesn’t serve images, replacing them with a solid colour. Then, once the user taps on “Load images”, those images are requested.</p><p>Arts and Culture is another example by Google, where you can browse art from museums. The placeholders give us a hint: we know that an image will appear there, we know the dimensions and we see a pleasant colour that transitions to the full image.</p><p>We don’t need to go too far to see this in action. Search for images on Google and you’ll see those placeholders. In case you are wondering, I was throttling the connection to record this. But if you are using a shared connection, or using internet on a plane, you will see them.</p><h4 id="Examples-of-Progressive-Image-Loading"><a href="#Examples-of-Progressive-Image-Loading" class="headerlink" title="Examples of Progressive Image Loading"></a>Examples of Progressive Image Loading</h4><p><em>More info on <a href="/medium-image-progressive-loading-placeholder">How Medium does progressive image loading</a></em></p><p>Moving on, let’s see some examples of sites that show a blurry image to transition to the final image.</p><p>One of the biggest sites using it is Medium. In this video we can see what the transition looks like. And because is web, we can inspect and see what’s going on behind the scenes. In order to do this they render a div, then they request a small thumbnail image, which they draw to a canvas. Then thy apply a blur effect. At the same time they request the large image, and when it is received they replace the canvas with the image.</p><p>The markup for the technique includes a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> for setting an intrinsic aspect ratio, then we have the small image, the large one, the canvas and a <code>&lt;noscript&gt;</code> tag to support browsers with JS disabled.</p><p>There are 2 interesting points in Medium’s implementation. One is that the thumbnail, though very small, it’s an external file. They could as well have inlined it in the initial payload. Secondly, <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> is an option for accomplishing the blur effect, but so are blur filter that can be applied using CSS or SVG.</p><p>Overall, one can’t say it is straightforward, but the point is to achieve lazy-loading of images, and a seamless transition between a small thumbnail and the large image to improve perceived performance.</p><h4 id="How-do-users-perceive-it"><a href="#How-do-users-perceive-it" class="headerlink" title="How do users perceive it?"></a>How do users perceive it?</h4><p>It seems fair to ask ourselves how do users see it?. I searched on Twitter to find some reactions and this is what I found.</p><p>But since this is a subjective topic, we also find people who don’t like it. This shouldn’t surprise us. We have had a similar technique for a long time in the form of progressive JPEGs. However, only 7% of JPEG images are progressive.</p><blockquote><p>“When, as with the Progressive JPEG method, image rendition is a two-stage process in which an initially coarse image snaps into sharp focus, cognitive fluency is inhibited and the brain has to work slightly harder to make sense of what is being displayed.”</p></blockquote><p>Users find it more difficult to process progressive JPEGs, even though at first sight we would think the experience is better.</p><h4 id="Is-this-technique-reliable"><a href="#Is-this-technique-reliable" class="headerlink" title="Is this technique reliable?"></a>Is this technique reliable?</h4><blockquote><p>“If you’re viewing this on desktop and the above image looks a bit blurry, please refresh the page…”</p></blockquote><p>It turns out that sometimes users end up just seeing the blurry images… which is probably worst than not seeing nothing at all.</p><h4 id="Facebook-Inlining-thumbnail-image-in-payload"><a href="#Facebook-Inlining-thumbnail-image-in-payload" class="headerlink" title="Facebook - Inlining thumbnail image in payload"></a>Facebook - Inlining thumbnail image in payload</h4><p>Medium are not alone on this. Facebook has also experimented with it for their mobile client in developing markets like India. For loading a profile page for a user, their app would make a request to fetch the data, which included the url for the cover photo image. Then, they needed to make a second request to fetch the image.</p><p>This is pretty standard, but they wanted to try to serve a small version of the image in the payload of the first request. They decided it should be smaller than 200 bytes for this to be worth it.</p><p>There was a problem, though. The headers of a JPEG image are larger of 200 bytes, but removing it they were close to 200 bytes. So they decided to use a common header for all images, which is stored in their client, and then only the JPEG data is returned.</p><p>Quite creative, right? In the path to solve the problem with loading images, we end up questioning the current formats and find work-arounds.</p><h4 id="Generating-tiny-thumbnails"><a href="#Generating-tiny-thumbnails" class="headerlink" title="Generating tiny thumbnails"></a>Generating tiny thumbnails</h4><p><em>More info on <a href="/webp-placeholder-images">Using WebP to create tiny preview images</a></em></p><p>I came across the article several months after it was posted. When I read it I wondered, how small can JPEG images be? I scaled down a few cover arts to 42x42 pixels, which is the size Facebook uses according to their post. And effectively, they were larger than their 200 Bytes budget.</p><p>Then I tried with other formats, like GIF and PNG, but they were even bigger. Until I tried with WebP, which resulted in roughly 1/4th of the size of the JPEG. One could say that the images are not exactly the same, and they are right. But once we apply a blur effect they look almost the same.</p><p>Regarding support for WebP, we should keep in mind that Facebook was trying to solve this for their mobile client. And there are libraries for rendering WebP on Android and iOS, so this seems a good solution.</p><h4 id="Getting-creative-with-SVGs"><a href="#Getting-creative-with-SVGs" class="headerlink" title="Getting creative with SVGs"></a>Getting creative with SVGs</h4><p><em>More info on <a href="/drawing-edges-svg">Using SVGs to achieve a cool drawing effect</a></em></p><p>Who doesn’t like SVGs? They are powerful and they can also be applied to image loading.</p><p>Some time ago I came across this site. It’s a review for the PS4 on Polygon.com. They use SVGs with an animation that looks like the image is being drawn.</p><p>Given a SVG it is easy to apply an animation of the stroke dash, as we see in this Spotify logo. On my quest to finding other ways to represent images, I thought of this technique. Sure thing, given a SVG we can “draw” it. But how can we apply this to bitmap images? Do we need to vectorize them?</p><p>It turns out we can draw the edges of an image. For that, we can detect the edges using an algorithm like Canny Edge. And the result is quite fun. The SVG is drawn and finally transitioned to the full image. We can detect edges, create polylines with SVG following those edges and apply the same technique we just saw to animate them.</p><p>The idea would be to pre-generate SVGs server-side, and inline them in the HTML. We have full control on how many lines to draw and the amount of detail. We can use a smaller version of the image to generate the points, still getting an accurate set of polylines. And the resulting SVG can be further optimized with svgo, and its size is around 2 or 3kB.</p><h4 id="Conclusions"><a href="#Conclusions" class="headerlink" title="Conclusions"></a>Conclusions</h4><p>Should we do this? I believe these techniques should be part of your toolbelt. The picture element is great for some applications, but we need to consider other scenarios like lazy-loading. Every approach has its advantages and disadvantages and we should use the more appropriate tool.</p><p>The Web is fun. You can right click and see the source code. The web is a great environment for anyone to learn. Go and experiment making your site faster.</p><p>Thanks!</p>]]></content>
